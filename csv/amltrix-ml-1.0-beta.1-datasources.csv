- **UK Sanctions List (OFSI)** – Maintained by the UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation.  
- **Other Country-Specific Lists** – Such as Canada’s Consolidated Sanctions List, Australia’s DFAT List, and Russia’s counter-sanctions lists.  

Sanctions lists are used in AML for:  
1. **Customer Due Diligence (CDD) & Know Your Customer (KYC)** – Screening individuals and entities during onboarding.  
2. **Transaction Monitoring & Screening** – Flagging or blocking transactions involving sanctioned parties.  
3. **Investigations & Reporting** – Supporting Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and law enforcement collaboration.
