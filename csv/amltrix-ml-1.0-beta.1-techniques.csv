attack-pattern--21bd5058-b64e-4bac-9625-c683c87d9a20,attack-pattern,Pig Butchering,"A specialized scam-based variant of Investment Fraud wherein criminals first establish false trust or relationships (often romantic or friendly) before urging victims to invest in fraudulent or manipulated opportunities, commonly centered around cryptocurrency . These scams—also referred to as Sha Zhu Pan—are frequently orchestrated by large criminal organizations in Southeast Asia, sometimes involving labor trafficking to staff call centers . Victims are led to believe they can generate high returns from seemingly legitimate trading applications or websites that display fictitious profits and temporarily allow small withdrawals to inspire further investments . In many cases, perpetrators direct victims to deposit funds into specific crypto wallets, decentralized exchanges, or even Bitcoin ATMs, which adds additional layers of obfuscation . Once the victim has deposited substantial capital, the scammers abruptly seize the funds, often routing them through multiple wallets and accounts to conceal the source, thereby complicating detection and AML efforts. These methods blend elements of romance fraud and investment fraud, exploiting personal trust and sophisticated laundering techniques to expand illicit proceeds on a global scale.","Launderers may systematically exploit “Pig Butchering” by cultivating fake personal relationships to persuade victims into funneling funds into fraudulent crypto platforms, then layering the illicit proceeds across multiple wallets, exchanges, and accounts to complicate AML detection.",2025-04-02T13:25:45.192478+00:00,2025-04-02T13:25:45.192478+00:00,2.1,True,attack-pattern--60e2df2b-69a5-41ec-a802-b764d1fb0003,Sha Zhu Pan; Romance Investment Scam,"[

They may employ 'loan-back' or 'back-to-back' arrangements, in which offshore shell entities nominally serve as lenders, allowing criminals to 'borrow' their own funds under the guise of legitimate agreements . Common traits include legally invalid or non-existent contracts, lack of genuine collateral, and inconsistencies in documentation that raise suspicion. Some perpetrators also abuse government-subsidized loan programs by overstating turnover or submitting falsified materials, fraudulently securing loans that may then go into default . In many schemes, false invoices or fabricated contractual records are introduced to justify transfers and disguise the true origin of funds . Criminals may further intermingle legitimate proceeds with illicit funds, allowing quick loan turnover, minimal interest or principal repayment, and strategic defaults to obscure ownership, frustrate investigators, and hamper financial transparency.","Launderers typically exploit illicit “loan-back” or “back-to-back” arrangements through offshore shell lenders, inserting their own funds as purported loans and masking the true origin of proceeds with sham contracts or inconsistent documentation.

attack-pattern--b47553a0-7086-4387-be7d-dcd9ee87789c,attack-pattern,Currency Exchange Conversions,"Criminals exploit both licensed and unlicensed currency exchange offices to execute multiple cross-currency swaps, continually shifting denominations to obscure the origin of illicit proceeds . By exploiting lax AML controls or inadequate customer due diligence, launderers can convert large sums into different fiat currencies, fragment the funds across multiple accounts or intermediaries, and then reconsolidate them under newly formed chains , . They often collaborate with complicit operators who overlook suspicious transaction patterns or ignore aggregated activity thresholds, allowing structured exchanges to remain undetected. In practice, once the funds have been converted among multiple denominations, tracing their origin becomes progressively more challenging, especially when smaller transfers are distributed through multiple providers . Cross-border wire transfers and other cross-currency services are particularly vulnerable to repeated layering, since oversight varies widely between jurisdictions, enabling criminals to operate below detection thresholds .

A key interrelation involves physically transporting large amounts of cash across borders to exploit discrepancies between official and unofficial exchange rates . Criminals partner with clandestine groups or facilitators who smuggle foreign currency into a target jurisdiction, where underground brokers offer premium rates for quick conversions without formal oversight. In some regions with inconsistent or underdeveloped AML controls, such as parts of West Africa, weak supervision and limited cross-border reporting requirements allow offenders to multiply illicit proceeds through repeated roundabout flows and cross-currency swaps, further obscuring the money’s origin . By merging cross-border smuggling with intentional currency fragmentation and repeated exchanges, offenders create complex transaction trails that significantly hinder investigators’ efforts to identify and recover criminal assets.","Launderers typically exploit both licensed and unlicensed exchange services to conduct successive cross-currency swaps, fragmenting and layering illicit proceeds through repeated conversions and transfers.

attack-pattern--bb258c00-9308-47de-aecc-0e1b1739616d,attack-pattern,Structuring,"Splitting illicit funds into smaller, less conspicuous amounts to avoid detection or threshold reporting is a widely used method across multiple stages of money laundering. While frequently initiated at the placement stage—introducing criminal proceeds into the financial system without triggering mandatory thresholds—it is equally effective during layering and integration, helping perpetrators obscure the origin of illicit funds and ultimately blend them into legitimate channels . Offenders typically break down large sums into increments below reporting triggers, depositing them across multiple accounts or under different sender identities through repeated transactions or distributed deposit channels . Some also use stored-value cards or money mules to fragment funds, exploiting minimal checks on lower-value sums . This approach is not limited to physical currency; structured wire transfers, digital wallets, and other non-cash instruments also circumvent detection thresholds. By ensuring each transaction remains small, criminals avoid automated alerts, complicate oversight, and facilitate subsequent laundering stages. Criminals may further enlist third-party depositors or cash couriers, who perform segmented placements into numerous bank accounts or payment systems, making it difficult for financial institutions to trace overall volumes . Variations on this method include smurfing—using numerous individuals or accounts for below-threshold operations—and remittance splitting, where sums are dispersed through multiple money transfer services to mask ultimate beneficiaries. In digital platforms, offenders divide deposits across ephemeral or newly generated addresses, further obscuring beneficial ownership. Regardless of the channel, the core objective remains consistent: to subvert conventional controls by systematically staying under official or institution-specific thresholds, thereby eluding standard transaction monitoring and reporting regimes.","Adversaries typically exploit structuring by splitting illicit proceeds into smaller, below-threshold amounts deposited under multiple accounts or via different channels, thereby circumventing mandatory reporting and complicating suspicious transaction monitoring.

By placing such assets beyond direct transaction records, they complicate detection efforts and can make phased withdrawals or staggered deposits without triggering typical AML thresholds. Some business express deposit boxes also provide higher depositor anonymity, further hindering compliance oversight. Criminals often pay rental fees fully in cash and avoid retaining lease documents at their residence to prevent any paper trail connecting them to the box . In some cases, they exploit lax identity checks by using third parties or signing under false identities, and store contraband (such as drugs or firearms) alongside illicit funds . In jurisdictions where national banking registries include safe deposit boxes, stronger oversight may drive criminals toward smaller or non-reporting banks to maintain secrecy .","Adversaries typically exploit safe deposit boxes to conceal illicit assets beyond formal transaction records, using third-party signatories or false identities to obscure direct links and circumvent AML thresholds.

attack-pattern--60e2df2b-69a5-41ec-a802-b764d1fb0003,attack-pattern,Fraud,"This illicit activity encompasses a broad range of deceptive practices intended to generate unlawful proceeds that qualify as predicate offenses under anti–money laundering frameworks. By fabricating or manipulating transactions, documentation, and representations, perpetrators create new streams of illicit capital at the outset rather than merely concealing funds derived from other crimes. These gains often pass through traditional banking channels, shell entities, or novel financial platforms, ultimately reaching the placement, layering, or integration stages with reduced suspicion. In certain documented cases, criminals submit bogus delivery notes or invoices to secure financing that is later funneled back to the issuer, effectively producing newly disguised proceeds . Others may engage in repeated re-invoicing or false-invoicing methods to artificially inflate or misrepresent the origin of goods and funds, enabling them to hide illicit assets under the guise of legitimate transactions . Some schemes also rely on fraudulent identity documentation or sham accounts, further obscuring the origin of newly acquired funds .

Many variations rely on forged invoices, fraudulent applications, or falsified eligibility criteria, blending legitimate transactions with contrived claims to mask the origin of the newly acquired funds. In certain schemes, perpetrators exploit government programs by submitting fabricated data—whether in relief, stimulus, or rebate contexts—to trigger disbursements that seem legitimate on paper. Others systematically circulate commodities or services through artificial billing cycles, as seen in specialized forms like Carousel Fraud  or Tax Rebate Fraud . In these cases, fraudsters repeatedly move the same goods (or false equivalents) across multiple jurisdictions or shell corporations, capitalizing on rebates, refunds, or other government payouts.

Once generated, the proceeds may be channeled through complex laundering methods. Criminals typically commingle legitimate and illicit gains in the same accounts, use structured deposits under multiple names, or transfer funds across numerous bank and money-service platforms. Shell companies and nominee arrangements frequently serve as conduits, enabling rapid distribution of funds under layers of corporate or personal identities. In more recent examples involving government relief programs , perpetrators have misrepresented business activity or identity information to capture high-volume payouts, then swiftly moved the funds to personal or third-party accounts.

Some variants involve persuading individual victims to hand over money under false pretenses, as seen in advance-fee or reward-based schemes . These often hinge on trust-building manipulations, urgent appeals, or embellished investment promises, only to vanish once the fraudster secures payment. Social media has also become a fertile medium for fraudulent charitable campaigns , leveraging emotional pleas to collect many small amounts that add up to substantial criminal profits.

Regardless of how it is carried out, fraud remains a key predicate offense for laundering because the funds begin as newly created criminal assets, often entering the financial system under the appearance of legitimacy.","Adversaries typically exploit fraud by acquiring illicit proceeds through deceptive schemes and then funneling them through complex financial transactions, thus concealing the criminal origins of the funds.",2025-04-02T13:25:45.254035+00:00,2025-04-02T13:25:45.254035+00:00,2.1,False,,Scam,"[

By commingling illegal proceeds with legitimate revenue, it conceals the true source of assets and attracts less scrutiny from financial institutions and authorities. These operations typically maintain a credible façade—physical locations, staff, or actual goods and services—while channeling unlawful earnings into their accounts.  

Criminals often choose enterprises with high cash turnovers, such as restaurants, retail shops, or entertainment venues, allowing significant amounts of illegal income to merge seamlessly with daily receipts.

By channeling transactions through online gaming environments with minimal AML scrutiny, launderers significantly obscure the origin of the funds . The trade of stolen or compromised game assets is common on dark web marketplaces, allowing instant monetization or multiple layering steps as items move between different jurisdictions . In some cases, criminals rely on centralized or decentralized exchange platforms that facilitate swaps between in-game currencies and fiat or cryptocurrency while requiring little or no customer verification .

Criminals are increasingly aware that public blockchains are only pseudo-anonymous, and leverage mixing to further mask their activity by blending tainted proceeds with legitimate flows, confounding straightforward tracing . Some mixers, particularly those built on CoinJoin-like mechanisms, shuffle multiple inputs and outputs in a single transaction, making it difficult to map any deposit directly to a given withdrawal . Criminals frequently combine mixing with other layering techniques, adding another layer of anonymity that impedes any single tracing approach. Law enforcement takedowns underscore the scale of these platforms—for example, the 2020 seizure of Bestmixer.io revealed over 25,000 bitcoins allegedly laundered in just one year . Non-compliant mixers such as Tornado Cash have similarly been used by North Korean cybercriminals to launder stolen assets at massive scale . Academic assessments also indicate that despite broad recognition of their illicit applications, mixers continue to be exploited to capitalize on remaining regulatory gaps and mask end-to-end transaction paths .","Adversaries typically exploit cryptocurrency mixing services to pool and shuffle illicit funds among legitimate deposits, obfuscating transaction paths and hampering investigators’ ability to detect suspicious flows.

By batching and automating these movements, they increase transactional volume and complexity, complicating investigative efforts. Many automated compliance solutions rely on data extracted from several source systems; however, incomplete or misaligned extraction processes can undermine effective screening . In addition, rules-based transaction monitoring thresholds are vulnerable to manipulation when criminals meticulously schedule or distribute payments so that they appear legitimate, thus evading detection . The resulting rapid-fire re-routing of funds across numerous jurisdictions or value instruments enables heightened layering, obscuring the money trail and slowing down regulatory audits.

Thanks to the global and financially complex nature of sports, large sums can move quickly between jurisdictions, intermixing legitimately documented transactions with hidden transfers. By structuring sponsorship agreements or image-rights payments, they can conceal the origin of illicit funds behind legitimate sports-related revenue streams. 

Where sponsors’ backgrounds are not thoroughly checked, corrupt actors can use club sponsorships and advertising deals as gateways to channel illicit capital into seemingly legitimate business structures . Meanwhile, image-rights contracts may be routed through multiple entities, sometimes offshore, making it difficult for authorities to track beneficial owners or identify the true source of funds . These layers, combined with the self-regulated nature of many sports organizations, enable criminals to bypass standard AML controls and add complexity when investigators attempt to follow suspicious transactions.","Launderers typically exploit club sponsorships, and player image-rights deals to obscure the origins of illicit funds, leveraging cross-border transfers, complex contractual arrangements, and the self-regulated nature of many sports organizations.

This practice not only sidesteps prohibited dealings with restricted entities or jurisdictions, but also generates illicit proceeds that qualify as a predicate offense for money laundering . Adversaries typically hide the true origin or destination of funds tied to sanctioned parties by creating complex networks of shell or front companies, using intermediary accounts, and forging documentation to obscure ownership relationships . They may route transactions through permissive jurisdictions with weak supervision or insufficient enforcement of export controls, sometimes taking cues from other sanctioned regimes’ methods . Trade-based mechanisms—often involving over- or under-invoicing—further help launder proceeds by embedding them in legitimate commercial flows . In the real estate sector, both residential and commercial properties can be purchased under intricate corporate structures to avoid detection and bypass screening . Service providers such as lawyers, accountants, trust and company formation agents, and even money service businesses are also exploited, given their potential to mask beneficial ownership and facilitate undisclosed cross-border transfers . More recently, illicit actors have relied on digital assets and stablecoins, leveraging cryptocurrency mixers or unregulated exchanges to move value beyond the reach of sanctions authorities .

By integrating suspect proceeds into day-to-day corporate transactions, they obscure the money trail behind multiple tiers of corporate relationships. This practice often exploits weak regulatory oversight or inconsistent corporate disclosure requirements across jurisdictions, capitalizing on gaps in business oversight and regulation. Research also shows that criminals may leverage weak corporate governance structures or manipulative accounting practices (for example, falsified fair value assessments) to disguise illicit income and conceal ultimate control of assets . In addition, sophisticated actors are known to register business entities across multiple regions, at times sharing addresses or management among these vehicles, to facilitate cross-border layering or sanctions evasion under the guise of normal corporate activity .

Criminals engaging in this technique often funnel or layer proceeds into formal financial channels—such as multiple brokerage accounts or shell entities—to disguise their origin. A common pattern includes well-timed, large-volume trades just before market-moving announcements, followed by rapid liquidation and the distribution of profits to multiple external accounts. In certain cases, the strong bonus-driven culture within some financial institutions and staff’s insufficient knowledge of insider dealing laws weaken compliance safeguards, allowing such trades to go undetected .

Criminals commonly rely on various financial services and instruments, including cross-border bank accounts, shell or front companies, and informal value transfer networks, to obscure the origin of these funds. Research indicates that, at the placement stage, commodity traffickers often utilize smurfing, structuring, or currency smuggling to introduce illicit proceeds into the financial system . During layering, shell and front companies are frequently employed to conceal beneficial ownership and integrate funds through import/export businesses, capital market investments, or transactions in the gold market . While this activity centers on trading goods whose nature or exchange is illicit, it also intersects with diverse financial channels—such as money service businesses and banks—that facilitate movement and concealment of proceeds. Trafficking differs from smuggling by emphasizing the illicit nature and sale of the goods themselves, whereas smuggling focuses on hiding how items are transported. Despite this distinction, both activities often overlap, as illicit traders commonly depend on covert transport methods to carry out the broader trade.","Adversaries typically exploit commodity trafficking by distributing contraband items to generate illicit proceeds, then layering those funds through trade-based methods or front companies to obscure their criminal origin.",2025-04-02T13:25:45.254035+00:00,2025-04-02T13:25:45.254035+00:00,2.1,False,,Black Market Commerce; Illicit Commodity Trading,"[

Criminals commonly launder these funds by mixing them with legitimate revenues, moving them through multiple jurisdictions, or using front companies that appear to operate in the same sector (e.g., fishing or logging). They also employ shell entities to obscure beneficial ownership, trade-based schemes reliant on falsified invoices and documentation, and corruption or bribery to secure fraudulent permits. According to various assessments, global proceeds from environmental crime range from USD 110 to 281 billion annually, highlighting the scale of revenue potentially entering the financial system . Regulators, including FinCEN, have noted a growing trend of illicit financial activity linked to these offenses, often facilitated by weak legislative environments and lax enforcement . Many jurisdictions now recognize environmental crime as a predicate offense for money laundering, yet disparities in legal frameworks and limited oversight persist .

By withholding what should have been paid to authorities, offenders generate proceeds that constitute a predicate offense for money laundering, as these illicit funds arise directly from tax crimes . Under this technique, individuals or entities may misclassify expenditures, shift reported income across multiple geographies, utilize undisclosed accounts or entities, and leverage complex corporate structures to obscure beneficial ownership details . These methods exploit vulnerabilities in financial oversight and often coincide with other illicit manipulation, such as funneling undeclared funds through real estate transactions or layering them in offshore bank accounts . Some jurisdictions report that up to 50% of potential tax revenue can be lost to these schemes, underscoring tax evasion’s impact on both public finances and overall money laundering risks .

Common related techniques include misclassifying personal expenses as business costs, transferring income or profits across borders without full disclosure, and employing undisclosed accounts or shell entities for concealing taxable sums. In many instances, offenders use payroll underreporting (Payroll Tax Evasion) or fabricate false claims for credits and rebates (Tax Rebate Fraud) to further mask or integrate these untaxed proceeds into the financial system. Financial institutions, unwittingly or otherwise, may serve as conduits if they fail to detect inconsistencies or unusual fund flows—especially where clients present opaque ownership structures or appear to live beyond their stated means. Ultimately, the central objectives remain the same: to evade legitimate tax liabilities, accumulate unlawful proceeds, and disguise these funds as legitimate revenue.","Adversaries typically exploit tax evasion or tax fraud by underreporting or falsifying financial information, generating untaxed proceeds that are then laundered through complex transactions or shell structures to obscure their criminal origin.",2025-04-02T13:25:45.254035+00:00,2025-04-02T13:25:45.254035+00:00,2.1,False,,Tax Fraud; Illicit Tax Avoidance,"[

This approach can involve informal proxies, family members, or shell business associates, all serving to layer or mask the underlying criminal ownership of funds. In practice, these schemes often leverage third-party electronic billers or similar intermediaries, which can conceal or omit key payer details and make identifying suspicious transactions more difficult . Within non-bank lending and similar environments, criminals may also use repeated structured payments or split loan repayments by multiple third-party depositors to disguise the true source and nature of the funds .

This process effectively layers the money, transforming it into fresh crypto outputs shielded from blockchain-based tracing. Remote mining services add another dimension of concealment: instead of running their own rigs, criminals pay hosting providers or rent cloud-based capacity, disguising illicit proceeds as legitimate fees for equipment, power, or hash-rate allocations . Once operational, newly generated coins are transferred to wallets under criminal control—often across borders—breaking any on-chain links to the original dirty money . Many remote mining facilities operate with minimal KYC or AML oversight, inadvertently enabling sanctions evasion and other illicit activities when customers’ true identities remain undisclosed . A notable 2022 enforcement action saw US authorities sanction a large remote mining operator alleged to have assisted Russia in monetizing cheap energy for cryptocurrency mining, illustrating how vulnerable these services are to exploitation .

This capability gained traction after the 2008 financial crisis, when shifting oversight resources facilitated broader adoption. By bypassing in-person deposit requirements, illicit actors can deposit sequentially numbered or physically altered checks into multiple accounts, rapidly cycling funds to evade direct scrutiny . Fraudsters often exploit RDC’s automated workflows by depositing the same or near-identical instruments across accounts within compressed timeframes. In some banks, a limited volume of suspicious activity reporting tied to RDC means irregular deposit patterns may go undetected.

These rapid, paired orders typically result in minimal or no net change in the accounts’ overall positions, making detection challenging for regulators and financial institutions. In many cases, the execution of identical buy and sell orders is used to convert or layer illicit profits with little discernible gain or loss. Stocks are commonly selected for these schemes due to their liquidity, while Securities Trading Platforms (including decentralized exchanges) can be exploited unwittingly if they fail to identify the simultaneous, offsetting trades.

Criminals deliberately isolate operational details across individuals, teams, and even distinct financial institutions so that no single party can piece together the broader laundering scheme. This highly fragmented structure applies to all stages of the process: some members may only handle physical cash deposits, while others handle wire transfers or set up shell-company paperwork without realizing how it interlocks with other channels . The absence of a unified overview also exploits institutional data silos, as many banks and service providers struggle to cross-reference and connect disparate information flows, making detection efforts more difficult. By keeping domains of knowledge separate, criminals reduce the likelihood of discovery and can quickly shift or replace any isolated component if it faces scrutiny.","Adversaries typically exploit knowledge compartmentalization by ensuring each participant only knows a fragment of the laundering operation, thereby minimizing the risk of full exposure and detection.",2025-04-02T13:25:45.297134+00:00,2025-04-02T13:25:45.297134+00:00,2.1,False,,Information Siloing,"[

Criminals exploit this technique to obscure ownership and the source of funds, produce fictitious business or personal identities, inflate invoice values, and falsify settlement records under the guise of legitimate operations. In practice, forged documents have been used to secure unauthorized bank disbursements and launder funds through multiple accounts, as shown in the “Turtle Island Resort” case where conspirators forged official records, obtained payments by virtue of those documents, and laundered illicit proceeds . Corrupt practitioners may also facilitate forgery to legitimize embezzlement schemes, as illustrated by bribed notaries fabricating official paperwork in Chen Shui-bian’s state fund scandal . In cross-border scenarios, forged documentation often appears in manipulated customs or shipping forms (e.g., misrepresented HS codes), enabling criminals to disguise suspicious flows across jurisdictions . In some instances, money launderers forge or alter identity documents to facilitate impersonation, shield or layer financial transactions, and thwart due diligence measures . By leveraging falsified records that appear authentic, criminals undermine standard oversight controls, disrupt compliance procedures, and complicate efforts to identify ultimate beneficiaries or detect the illicit origins of financial flows.","Launderers may forge or falsify documents to obscure beneficial ownership and the true source of funds, fabricate fictitious identities or inflated invoices, and thereby subvert due diligence controls while complicating efforts to trace illicit proceeds.",2025-04-02T13:25:45.297134+00:00,2025-04-02T13:25:45.297134+00:00,2.1,False,,,"[

In many cases, criminals merge real stolen personal information with fabricated data to generate a new “synthetic” identity, enabling them to pass automated checks and build credit histories that appear legitimate . They also exploit remote onboarding procedures by digitally manipulating identity documentation (for example, altering images or metadata) to evade fraud detection and take over customer accounts . During account opening, validation and verification steps are susceptible to falsified data, especially when institutions rely heavily on automated controls . Once established, criminals may tamper with transaction histories or account data to conceal ties to illicit origins. Warning signs include sudden or repeated changes to personal information, consistent sets of overlapping identity details across seemingly unrelated profiles, and unverifiable or contradictory customer documentation and backgrounds. These methods feed into subtechniques such as Name Alteration—where manipulated spellings and aliases frustrate watchlist screening—and Fraudulent KYC Documentation—where forged or stolen materials (sometimes bundled as “KYC kits”) bypass due diligence thresholds, ensuring illicit proceeds flow without revealing ultimate beneficiaries.

Once abroad, they perform currency exchanges or transfers under the guise of lawful funds, returning the proceeds in different denominations or forms. In many jurisdictions, these declarations are rarely verified or counted in detail, allowing criminals to over-declare the amount upon entry so as to legitimize additional illicit funds later deposited or circulated . Re-using or falsifying declaration records multiple times also enables them to obscure the cash’s true origin, especially if authorities fail to match these records with other cross-border movement data . In other instances, criminals break down large sums into multiple smaller declarations or distribute amounts across several currencies to stay below threshold checks—a tactic sometimes referred to as “smurfing” . Notably, some cases show perpetrators subdividing the declared value into amounts of around USD 8,500 per currency, cumulatively reaching USD 28,000 or more, while remaining below official reporting limits . This official paper trail makes it difficult for investigators to link the declared amounts to their actual illicit source, helping perpetrators circumvent standard anti-money laundering controls.","Launderers typically exploit lax cross-border cash declaration processes by openly declaring large sums to lend legitimacy, then falsifying or recycling those declarations and distributing amounts (“smurfing”) below threshold checks.

By orchestrating manipulative trades in capital markets—such as pump-and-dump, spoofing, or wash trading—they can transform illicit proceeds into profit-like returns, effectively integrating them into the financial system . This complexity, coupled with the high volume and volatility of equity transactions, obscures the criminal origin of funds, while final proceeds may appear to be legitimate, market-driven returns once positions are exited.

In pump-and-dump scenarios, perpetrators hype an asset using false or misleading statements, then quickly sell after the price peaks . Low-liquidity shares or penny stocks are often targeted because they are easier to manipulate, and multiple accounts or shell companies can be used to conduct circular trading . Advanced electronic trading channels, such as direct market access, allow for rapid and layered transactions designed to evade scrutiny .

This technique involves several common methods:

- **Over- or Under-Invoicing**: By falsely reporting unit prices or quantities, criminals can move additional value or conceal proceeds. This involves inflating or deflating the value of goods on invoices, thereby transferring illicit funds under the guise of legitimate trade .

- **Multiple Re-Invoicing**: This involves issuing inflated invoices with exaggerated administrative costs. These invoices are often settled with cash deposits that lack clear references to actual shipments, further obscuring the transaction trail .

- **Phantom Shipping**: Criminals forge shipping or customs documentation, creating discrepancies between declared and actual cargo. This technique allows for the movement of funds without the physical movement of goods, making it difficult for authorities to track .

- **Blending Illicit Cargo with Legitimate Shipments**: By mixing illegal goods with legal shipments, criminals can disguise the true nature of the cargo, complicating detection efforts.

- **Manipulation of Trade Finance Instruments**: Instruments such as documentary credits and letters of credit are manipulated to disguise the nature or market value of shipped goods. This manipulation leverages the complexity of trade finance to hide illicit activities .

Criminals often exploit multiple jurisdictions with inconsistent AML oversight, adding layers of complexity and regulatory blind spots. This fragmentation of transactions, combined with repeated amendments to shipping routes and quantities, effectively scatters illicit capital behind seemingly routine commercial operations. 

In many cases, importers and exporters collude to reuse or alter invoices, justifying repeated payments or billing for ""intangible"" goods, such as digital products or consulting services, whose fair market value is difficult to determine . By exploiting paperwork-dependent trade finance instruments and self-reported transaction data, they leverage jurisdictional disparities and inadequate oversight to obscure the true value or even the existence of shipped goods . 

The use of multiple financial institutions and added layers of invoicing further complicates traceability.

By forging or manipulating key details (such as reference numbers, shipment values, or goods specifications), criminals complicate the flow of funds and thwart standard compliance checks . In some cases, offenders forge entire documents or alter existing ones—adjusting values, modifying payee details, or creating fictitious reference data—to legitimize otherwise illicit transfers.

Criminals exploit routine brokerage operations by booking these transactions in multiple locations, effectively transferring monetary value under the appearance of ordinary market trades. In practice, the same or linked parties place mirrored orders on different exchanges or desks so that one position offsets the other, with no real market risk or change in beneficial ownership. These offsetting trades can be rapidly repeated or ‘layered’ across jurisdictions, and the complexity of modern trading infrastructure often allows hundreds of remote traders or shell entities to book business in a central location with limited oversight or verification. The process is especially appealing during layering, as it embeds illicit proceeds in normal securities transactions, thereby reducing the likelihood of triggering conventional AML checks tied to deposits or wire thresholds. Regulatory findings have shown that mirror trades, along with other techniques like wash trading and offsetting transactions, are highly suggestive of financial crime risk when used to shift large sums internationally with little economic rationale . As a result, firms facilitating such trades, including potentially complicit or negligent brokers, may unwittingly enable criminals to transfer value effortlessly across borders with minimal detection.","Adversaries typically exploit mirror trading by orchestrating offsetting buy and sell orders in multiple jurisdictions, instantly transferring value without real market risk or beneficial ownership change.

They frequently rely on front or shell companies – such as massage businesses, bars, or recruitment agencies – to co-mingle illicit funds with legitimate revenue [569, 1314]. Funds may also be hidden through false payroll and underreported wages, especially in high-risk labor markets. Adversaries commonly structure or layer transactions across multiple jurisdictions through wires or funnel accounts, complicating detection and tracing [226, 872].

A common tactic involves converting illegal proceeds into betting chips or tokens, placing only minimal wagers, and then redeeming those chips as if they were legitimate winnings . This process obscures the source of the money by generating records that appear innocuous.

In some scenarios, individuals place bets on opposing outcomes of an even contest or structure wagers strategically to minimize net losses while still generating documentation that suggests legitimate gains . Criminal groups may also exploit staff vulnerabilities, forge receipts, or coordinate with confederates in techniques like chip-dumping or match fixing. These manipulations disguise the true ownership of funds and complicate AML oversight, particularly in environments with inconsistent regulation or gaps in verifying customer identities.

Although some criminals employ online gambling platforms for rapid transfers and reduced face-to-face scrutiny , physical venues remain a prominent target. By infiltrating or purchasing gambling operations in jurisdictions with weak supervision, criminals can launder larger sums under the guise of fully documented gaming transactions. The ability to convert raw cash into tokens and redeem it as legally obtained proceeds, combined with the relative anonymity of these venues, makes them a potent channel for layering illicit capital behind the appearance of routine wagering.","Launderers typically exploit gambling channels by converting illicit funds into betting chips or credits, placing minimal wagers, and then encashing purported winnings to obscure the source of proceeds.

Recruits receive illicit funds in their personal accounts and forward them to third parties, making the source of funds harder to trace. This distribution of transactions across multiple social media recruits creates additional barriers for investigators. In many cases, these criminals, sometimes referred to as “mule herders,” exploit the reach of popular social platforms and messaging apps to quickly expand their network of unwitting or complicit recruits across jurisdictions [1022, 245]. They may also showcase lavish lifestyles or present seemingly legitimate “remote work” offers to entice financially desperate individuals, who are often promised small commissions for transferring illicit funds . Once engaged, mules may unwittingly become part of a larger layering scheme, repeatedly moving funds between multiple accounts and minimizing any direct link to the launderers. This approach capitalizes on the real-time, transnational connectivity of social media, complicating AML and law enforcement efforts to identify and disrupt money mule networks.","Adversaries typically exploit social media by recruiting unwitting or complicit money mules with promises of easy earnings, channeling illicit proceeds through personal accounts to obscure transaction trails.

attack-pattern--36bff454-e21c-45c7-b773-2aabc90451f4,attack-pattern,Multiple Citizenship Identities,"Criminals maintain more than one nationality or passport to obscure their true identities and reduce scrutiny when opening financial accounts or conducting cross-border transactions. Leveraging multiple citizenship statuses allows them to bypass or manipulate varied KYC requirements and beneficial ownership regulations across different jurisdictions, making it harder to trace illicit fund sources. While holding multiple citizenships is not inherently illegal, criminals exploit it to present alternative documents—thus creating fragmented account profiles and diminishing the likelihood of consistent, enhanced due diligence. In some cases, these individuals already have dual citizenship through birth or marriage, while others may obtain additional passports using formal or informal means. Criminals can also combine these alternate nationality documents with forged or borrowed identities to open or register bank accounts under different personas, further hampering investigators and reducing the effectiveness of AML controls . They sometimes use layered shell entities across multiple jurisdictions, compounding beneficial ownership obfuscation and making it extremely difficult for authorities to pinpoint the true identity behind illicit transactions . See subtechnique (ID #408) for cases involving citizenship-by-investment routes, where criminals actively purchase new passports or residency to strengthen their ability to evade standard verification checks. When seeking new travel documents from official Citizenship or Residency by Investment (CBI/RBI) programs, launderers mask their criminal background or misrepresent financial resources to meet investment thresholds. Once these programs grant them fresh legal status, they can open accounts or initiate cross-border transfers under new identities with minimal scrutiny. For high-risk applicants, weak vetting requirements in certain jurisdictions can accelerate approvals and undermine global AML efforts. Corruption in the application process can also speed document issuance and ensure anonymity. Additionally, there often are no sufficient procedures to revoke or retrieve passports if a recipient’s risk level changes, allowing criminals continued access to these identities. By strategically selecting passports from jurisdictions with weaker AML regimes or lax disclosure laws, adversaries expand their options for layering transactions, concealing beneficial ownership, and avoiding investigative triggers. Multiple citizenship identities can thus facilitate more seamless cross-border movement of illicit proceeds, exploiting regulatory blind spots and inconsistencies across financial institutions. This poses elevated jurisdictional risk when criminals rely on passports from states where AML enforcement is limited, as well as heightened customer risk due to the resulting complexity in beneficial ownership checks. Cryptocurrency exchange services are especially vulnerable when adversaries rotate between different passports or nationalities to bypass KYC thresholds, while credit and debit cards linked to parallel identities aid in moving value undetected. Operational indicators include a customer shifting passport or nationality details over time, opening accounts in multiple jurisdictions, or utilizing newly acquired citizenship from a recognized offshore center without clear personal or economic rationale. Criminals frequently select programs with minimal or weak vetting requirements, effectively “forum shopping” for jurisdictions whose due diligence standards are lower or inconsistently applied . The European Commission has noted these investment-based schemes as particularly vulnerable to money laundering, tax evasion, and corruption, given that prospective applicants can inject illicit proceeds to secure legitimate documentation . In some instances, corruption within the application process further facilitates quick access to new identity documents, heightening anonymity and mobility. Once approved, limited or nonexistent mechanisms to revoke or physically retrieve the passport can allow criminals to continue using these newly acquired identities undetected, even if their risk profile changes .","Adversaries may strategically acquire and exploit multiple citizenship identities to circumvent KYC processes, opening accounts under alternative nationalities and reducing the consistency of due diligence across different jurisdictions.

In this arrangement, a criminal organization sells its U.S. dollars at a discount to a peso broker, who provides local currency in exchange. The broker then uses those dollars to settle foreign trade invoices on behalf of importers, often purchasing goods from the United States and shipping them into Latin America . Although some Black Market Peso Exchange transactions involve under-invoicing, smuggling, or partial documentation to reduce import duties, model variations do not always require collusion by the importer or exporter—importers simply pay the broker in local currency to secure access to harder-to-obtain U.S. dollars .

attack-pattern--3c407c24-b9fe-4103-80d2-aeca22620ce4,attack-pattern,Lottery Winnings,"Criminals exploit official lottery mechanisms to obscure illicit funds by purchasing large volumes of tickets or by acquiring winning tickets directly from legitimate recipients, then redeeming the proceeds under their own name . As noted in documented cases, some drug trafficking organizations systematically use this approach to convert illegally obtained cash into apparently legitimate lottery gains . In certain investigations, large winnings, such as a multi-million-dollar prize in Massachusetts, were split between a legitimate winner and a criminal enterprise seeking to launder proceeds . Criminals may pay a premium for partial or entire stakes in a winning ticket, allowing the original prize earner to remain discreet while shifting redemption—and the appearance of lawful wealth—to the criminal . Front companies or third-party associates sometimes redeem the tickets further downstream, adding a layer of complexity to ownership structures and making it more difficult to trace the actual source of funds . In other instances, fabricated claims of lottery earnings have been used to explain unexplained asset inflows or sudden surges in net worth, bypassing normal scrutiny of high-risk cash transactions .

Typical indicators include bulk cash purchases of tickets, quick shifts in buying patterns following large deposits, frequent third-party prize claims, repeated redemption amounts just below mandatory reporting thresholds, and the use of multiple sales points or online platforms in close succession. Frequent ticket purchases made in cash, abrupt or inadequately explained sources of wagering funds, and the use of shell entities or nominees to claim prizes are additional red flags. Organized criminal groups have demonstrated willingness to employ front companies, layering schemes, and partial-ticket acquisitions in multiple jurisdictions, confirming that the manipulation of legitimate lottery systems remains a central mechanism in converting illicit capital into seemingly clean assets .","Launderers typically exploit official lottery processes by purchasing large ticket volumes or acquiring winning tickets from legitimate recipients, then redeeming or splitting proceeds to mask the illicit origin of funds.

Large volumes of points are in circulation worldwide (with the United States alone exceeding USD 48 billion in unredeemed miles and bonuses), yet they remain mostly unregulated . In many cases, there is no formal limit on how many points can be loaded or stored on an account, enabling substantial value to be accumulated without triggering traditional AML controls . Some loyalty schemes are evolving into quasi-payment systems, allowing users to purchase or earn points that can be redeemed across a wide network of merchants or even exchanged in secondary markets . Depending on their design, loyalty points may function similarly to private digital currencies—particularly where peer-to-peer transfers or cross-platform pooling is permitted—increasing the complexity of tracing suspicious transactions . While FATF guidance does not explicitly regulate many so-called “closed-loop” programs, criminals can still exploit them if points are widely accepted, transferable, or convertible into fiat .

This practice, itself a predicate offense in AML/CFT contexts, frequently involves using shell companies or doctored workforce records to conceal the genuine wage base or tax liability, misrepresenting employee counts or relying on undocumented workers, and submitting fraudulent filings to authorities. Recent advisories highlight a growing trend in the construction sector, where offenders create shell businesses whose sole purpose is to process large payrolls without appropriate withholdings or insurance coverage, paying employees in cash or via checks drawn on the shell’s account and disguising true workforce size . Undocumented individuals sometimes manage these shell entities or perform the underlying work, exacerbating underreporting and reducing transparency. In certain cases, employees also fail to disclose these wages, compounding personal tax evasion risks . Financial institutions, especially banks and check-cashing services, can be unwitting conduits—processing the undeclared wages and allowing illicit proceeds to mingle with legitimate funds. Ultimately, the core outcomes are unpaid payroll taxes and insurance premiums, with pilfered amounts reinvested or layered into the financial system under the guise of bona fide business revenue.","Adversaries typically exploit payroll tax obligations by underreporting wages through shell companies and falsified workforce records, allowing them to evade taxes and channel unrecorded proceeds into mainstream financial systems while concealing their true liabilities.",2025-04-02T13:25:46.659060+00:00,2025-04-02T13:25:46.659060+00:00,2.1,True,attack-pattern--f3bacfce-146e-406d-a812-ec3117d06d05,Payroll Tax Evasion and Workers' Compensation Fraud,"[

Common examples include hawala or Chinese underground banks, where operators settle accounts via reciprocal transactions, off-the-books ledgers, or trade-based offsets in place of standard wire transfers. This setup allows criminals to bypass conventional AML/KYC controls, moving significant amounts of illicit proceeds discreetly across borders.

It yields significant illicit proceeds that serve as a predicate offense for money laundering. Criminals typically exploit conflict zones and embargo violations to facilitate these transactions, and corruption often plays a key role in enabling access to or movement of weaponry across borders . Several groups engaged in terrorism or organized crime rely on arms trafficking both to maintain active supply channels and to generate revenue, intertwining it with other crimes, such as drug trafficking or extortion . International bodies, including the FATF, recognize the clear links between arms trafficking, terrorist financing, and broader money laundering concerns . While this activity focuses on the illicit nature of the goods themselves—firearms and other weaponry—smuggling refers primarily to the clandestine methods of transport and evasion.

Mules receive bulk fiat currency derived from illegal sources and deposit it into multiple crypto ATMs—often below daily or per-transaction limits—to avoid suspicious reporting thresholds . In some cases, drug-trafficking organizations or other illicit operators instruct these mules to purchase bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies at such terminals, then immediately transfer the funds to wallets abroad, effectively obfuscating the trail and distancing proceeds from their criminal origin . Criminals also exploit the relative anonymity of unregistered or non-compliant ATM operators, repeatedly conducting deposits and withdrawals across regions to further scatter transaction patterns. In addition, bad actors may coerce or deceive victims into physically depositing cash for them at crypto ATMs, instructing the victim to scan a prepaid wallet address or QR code so that the purchased crypto is diverted to addresses under criminal control. By pushing the nominal ownership and KYC burden onto victims or mules, launderers mask their true identities and swiftly cross jurisdictional boundaries, complicating detection and enforcement by financial institutions and investigative agencies. This approach allows for high-volume movement of criminal proceeds into the crypto ecosystem, where criminals can continue layering funds through multiple wallets or subsequent exchange points. Once placed in crypto form, illicit proceeds can be withdrawn in other currencies, converted back to fiat through regulated or unregulated services, or further transferred among self-hosted wallets that lack comprehensive KYC obligations, creating additional obstacles for investigators and regulators.","Launderers typically exploit crypto ATM mules by directing them to convert illicit fiat currency into cryptocurrency while relying on weak or nonexistent KYC measures to swiftly obscure transaction chains.

This arrangement breaks the direct link between deposit and withdrawal addresses, thereby obscuring fund provenance and ownership. Unlike decentralized (non-custodial) mixers, all assets are held under a single operator’s control, which introduces both a single point of failure and a dependency on the operator’s honesty and security practices. Criminals favor custodial mixers for rapid and large-scale laundering, capitalizing on minimal compliance oversight and exploiting the service’s capacity to blend illicit funds with legitimate cryptocurrency flows. Many custodial mixers are reported to ignore regulatory obligations entirely, further impeding investigators’ ability to trace transactions.

By exploiting countries with lax real estate oversight or minimal beneficial-ownership disclosure, they further complicate investigative efforts and obscure the money trail. They commonly employ multi-layered ownership structures, sometimes routed through shell companies or trusts, to disguise the ultimate beneficial owners and conceal the origin of illicit proceeds . In jurisdictions lacking centralized registries or robust transparency requirements, law enforcement struggles to trace real estate transactions back to the true owners, allowing criminals to integrate laundered funds into seemingly legitimate property portfolios .

Rather than sending money via standard electronic or physical channels, participants match counterpart transactions (or goods) in different locales, thereby avoiding direct bank transfers and formal recording. This method is particularly attractive to criminals looking for rapid, largely undocumented value flows. Settlement often involves trade-based offsets, where obligations across borders are netted out through parallel businesses or commodity exchanges, limiting the need for direct banking transactions. These arrangements can be favored among certain diaspora or cross-border corridors due to speed, cost advantages, and familiarity compared to formal channels .","Adversaries could exploit Hot Transfers by offsetting accounts and commodities like gold across multiple jurisdictions, thereby avoiding formal bank transfers and documentation.

Once operational, newly generated coins flow directly to wallets designated by the criminal—often in separate jurisdictions—severing on-chain links to the original dirty money . Many remote mining operators lack robust KYC or AML measures and may unknowingly facilitate sanctions evasion or other illegal activities when their customers’ true identities remain undisclosed . In one notable case, US authorities sanctioned a major remote mining provider in 2022 for allegedly aiding Russia in monetizing cheap energy resources for cryptocurrency mining, illustrating the potential for these services to be exploited for illicit financial purposes .

Criminals exploit this autonomy to bypass KYC requirements, enabling cross-border movement of illicit proceeds or transfers between pseudonymous addresses without centralized monitoring . Because there is no central entity to impose compliance checks or freeze accounts, self-hosted wallets serve as a potent avenue for hiding and relocating illegal funds. Moreover, self-hosted addresses often lie outside direct AML/CFT obligations, complicating due diligence for regulated intermediaries handling inbound or outbound funds .

Child Technique – Privacy Wallets: Certain non-custodial wallets incorporate additional anonymity features—coinjoin protocols, stealth addresses, or zero-knowledge proofs—to further mask beneficial ownership and transaction histories. While partly intended for legitimate privacy, these capabilities can be misused to hamper investigations and bypass AML checks. Some wallets offer built-in coinjoin-based services that commingle user funds, severing the chain of custody between sender and recipient . In many cases, criminals also chain-hop from transparent cryptocurrencies into these wallets to layer proceeds and fragment the transaction trail . Investigations reveal an escalating share of illicit funds flowing through privacy wallets rather than traditional mixers, with analyses indicating a measurable proportion of laundered assets moving through these tools . Although some financial institutions now screen inbound and outbound transfers for known privacy wallet addresses, advanced anonymity features still challenge regulatory oversight and complicate detection .","Adversaries typically exploit privacy wallets’ enhanced anonymity features—like coinjoin protocols or stealth addresses—to obscure ownership, layer illicit proceeds across pseudonymous addresses, and evade AML/CFT detection.

This setup obscures the real decision-maker or source of funds, impeding AML transparency and hindering reliable identification of ultimate beneficial ownership. Criminals often leverage delegated authorities (such as powers of attorney) to create a separation between formal ownership and actual control, frustrating know-your-customer efforts and concealing the genuine source or ownership of assets in a deeper, more systematic way . In jurisdictions that do not require ongoing checks of beneficial owners or allow incomplete documentation, proxies can remain undetected, especially if the proxy’s actions blend in with the account’s usual operations. In some cases, the hidden beneficial owner may be a politically exposed person or senior figure operating from a high-secrecy jurisdiction, complicating scrutiny further . These proxies may also be close family members or associates who deposit or transfer large sums on behalf of the true principal, effectively shielding the principal’s identity from financial institutions and authorities. Such arrangements highlight the need for enhanced due diligence measures, re-validation of third-party mandates, and thorough ongoing monitoring to detect changes in control and beneficial ownership status.","One individual or entity (the proxy) transacts or performs other actions on behalf of the true beneficial owner, obscuring the real source or decision-maker.

This layering tactic buries the illicit origin within normal payroll operations, making it harder to detect the suspicious money flow or trace its criminal source. By synchronizing repayment schedules with genuine pay cycles, criminals mimic legitimate debt servicing, obscuring early payouts or unexpectedly large installments that are actually funded by illicit proceeds . In some cases, they use fictitious loan agreements or “loan-back” arrangements where the perpetrator’s own illicit money is loaned back to them through an associate, then repaid under the guise of standard payroll deductions . These disguised installments help merge dirty funds into the loan product incrementally, aligning with normal wage-oriented transactions and reducing red flags.

Because these workers lack formal documentation, they rarely appear in conventional payroll systems, intensifying the opacity and facilitating the commingling of illicit funds with purported labor costs. By avoiding official payroll channels, criminals can camouflage substandard recordkeeping and evade tax or social insurance obligations. This method is especially common in cash-intensive trades, such as construction or other labor-focused sectors, where subcontracting arrangements and multiple project layers provide cover for untracked wage payouts . Off-the-books payments may also be used by transnational criminal organizations leveraging shell businesses, minimal insurance coverage, or falsified records to pay a larger workforce in unrecorded cash, thereby masking the ultimate source of the funds . In doing so, illicit proceeds can be blended into ordinary operating expenses, shielded from standard audits, and concealed behind seemingly legitimate labor costs, significantly impairing oversight and detection efforts.","Launderers may hire undocumented workers and pay them exclusively in off-the-books cash, thereby commingling illicit funds with purported labor expenses and evading standard payroll scrutiny.

Traders time trades so that several parties appear entitled to dividend tax credits, causing tax authorities to pay out more than the legitimate amount. Collusion with brokers or financial professionals often facilitates rapid share transfers that blur ownership records, directly generating illicit proceeds from government funds. While some forms of dividend stripping (sometimes referred to as “cum-cum”) are not illegal in certain jurisdictions, they can significantly erode tax revenues by shifting stocks to entities in lower-tax locales just before dividend payment and then selling them back. Once dividend stripping was prohibited in parts of Europe, “cum-ex” emerged as a more overtly fraudulent scheme relying on multiple transfers of shares around dividend dates to obscure the rightful owner and collect duplicate tax rebates. This practice reportedly cost EU member states over EUR 55 billion, including at least EUR 7.2 billion in losses for Germany between 2005 and 2012. Criminal facilitators deliberately targeted jurisdictions with weaker enforcement to minimize the likelihood of prosecution.

By leveraging inconsistent AML controls or currency regulations, they create numerous transactional layers to obscure the true origin of funds. These rapid swaps also exploit arbitrage opportunities across various banking systems and currency corridors, further complicating detection efforts. Criminals exploit both licensed and unlicensed currency exchange offices to execute multiple cross-currency swaps, obscuring the origin of illicit proceeds by continually shifting denominations. They often divide or structure funds to avoid detection, then perform successive exchanges—sometimes in collusion with complicit operators who overlook suspicious transaction patterns . By exploiting lax AML controls or inadequate customer due diligence, launderers can convert large sums to different fiat currencies, fragment funds further across multiple accounts or intermediaries, and then reconsolidate under newly formed chains . In many cases, they deliberately seek out exchange services or money changers where controls are weak or non-existent, enabling them to circumvent restrictions and compliance obligations . After each conversion, the launderers may transfer or wire proceeds to additional accounts, repeating the cycle of layering and making each transaction more difficult to trace. This fundamental layering approach relies on the rapid turnover of multiple currencies, often across multiple jurisdictions, to break the trail of illicit assets. Moreover, informal networks and subtechniques such as multi-currency swap chains or cross-border arbitrage scenarios allow criminals to exploit regulatory gaps and fragment the link to the initial crime, making downstream detection even more challenging. In practice, once the funds are exchanged among multiple denominations, tracing their origin becomes increasingly difficult, especially when smaller transfers are structured and distributed through multiple providers . Cross-border money transfer services, in particular, are considered inherently more vulnerable to repeated layering efforts, as oversight can vary widely and create opportunities for criminals to remain below detection thresholds .","Adversaries typically exploit multi-currency swaps by repeatedly exchanging illicit funds between different fiat currencies and jurisdictions—leveraging inconsistent AML controls and regulatory loopholes—to fragment transaction trails, obscure origins, and evade detection.

Some schemes involve forged receipts or buying winning tickets from legitimate gamblers at a premium, enabling launderers to document false gains instead of disclosing the true criminal origin . In other instances, proceeds (e.g., from drug trafficking) are directly exchanged for chips and later cashed out as purported gambling profits, even though actual wagering may be minimal .

By circumventing standard documentation, these disbursements reduce transparency and obscure the true origin of the money. This technique is particularly common in small or medium-sized cash-intensive businesses, which may under-report revenues and avoid social insurance or income tax obligations by using off-the-books payments . For example, some employers exploit local norms or preferences for cash usage, especially in culturally or linguistically diverse communities, to minimize scrutiny and facilitate untracked wage payouts . Such practices allow criminals to embed illicit funds in ordinary payroll expenses and further reduce the visibility of suspicious financial activity.

By strategically overstating or understating valuations, criminals can disguise illicit funds as lawful cross-border transactions, complicating efforts to trace their origin. This scheme often exploits self-reported trade finance processes, leveraging inconsistent data oversight to obscure money flows. Research indicates misinvoicing can account for over 20% of international trade between certain developing and developed nations, signifying a major driver of illicit financial outflows .

By creating false bank accounts and fictitious digital transactions, they exploit minimal beneficial ownership disclosure and jurisdictional gaps, often relying on corporate service providers to set up these entities remotely . As these enterprises operate entirely on virtual platforms, it becomes significantly harder for institutions to verify actual controllers or beneficiaries, especially when criminals use virtual business addresses and nominee directors to conceal their identities . These entities can be quickly shifted across jurisdictions or closed down to evade detection.

Officials or employees misuse their trusted positions to siphon public monies into private channels—funds that must then be laundered through financial systems to disguise their origin. This method is especially prevalent among politically exposed persons exerting direct control over public accounts or contracts. In many jurisdictions, corruption schemes involving politically exposed persons (PEPs) receive heightened scrutiny due to the elevated risk and potential scale of illicit revenue. Additionally, some jurisdictions treat 'illicit enrichment' as a criminal offense for situations where a public official’s assets substantially exceed their lawful income, a measure often supported by mandatory asset declarations and parallel financial probes to detect unexplained wealth .

Practical cases reveal frequent reliance on layering strategies such as using bureaux de change, funnel accounts, and foreign shell companies to conceal stolen funds . For example, documented instances in Nigeria illustrate collusion between procurement officers and contractors to over-invoice amounts, divert public funds in cash, and launder them through designated non-financial institutions . Similarly, some public officials have shifted misappropriated sums into luxury real estate, markets abroad, or corporate vehicles to mask their origin and cash flow . When public officials maintain or exercise direct access over large funds or state-backed natural resources, they may use covert transfers and offshore transactions to complicate tracing. In instances of massive fraud or embezzlement, suspects typically exploit weak oversight controls in national procurement, fiscal management, or budgeting procedures. Ultimately, layered laundering techniques—including repeated cross-border wires, integration via real estate, or funneling via shell entities—help obscure the provenance of these illicit funds and frustrate investigators, underscoring the need for strengthened anti-corruption measures, transparency, and regulatory vigilance.","Adversaries typically misappropriate public funds by leveraging their official authority to divert state resources into personal channels, then launder these proceeds through layering techniques—such as funnel accounts, foreign shell companies, or offshore transfers—to obscure illicit origins and thwart AML/CFT controls.",2025-04-02T13:25:49.633986+00:00,2025-04-02T13:25:49.633986+00:00,2.1,True,attack-pattern--8b997f33-6b13-40c0-bde8-bdfdc788c735,Misappropriation; Skimming; Siphoning; Embezzlement of Public Funds,"[

They frequently channel these funds through shell or obscurely owned companies, citing nebulous or fictitious deliverables to justify sizeable transfers. By labeling outflows as “consulting,” “marketing,” or “business process outsourcing,” offenders obscure the true purpose of the funds and present unlawful income as normal business receipts . Through these steps, they effectively integrate illegal capital into standard financial channels as if it stemmed from legitimate commerce.  

A common subtype of this tactic is establishing or acquiring consulting firms—sometimes with preexisting reputations—and systematically intermingling illegal proceeds with legitimate revenues . The intangible nature of consulting services and highly subjective pricing facilitate artificially inflated or overbilled fees . In numerous cases, only partial services are provided or none at all, backed up by spurious or notarized documents . Offenders may meticulously pay taxes on these inflated revenues, seeking to reduce official scrutiny . Furthermore, entities are often registered in multiple jurisdictions or secrecy-prone locales, making it difficult to identify beneficial owners . In other schemes, criminals secure overvalued or unfulfilled official contracts, redirecting public or private funds to their consulting fronts . By consistently characterizing their revenue as consulting or management income, offenders blur the true source of their funds and lessen the chances of detection by compliance teams and regulators.  

This method exploits service agreements that are highly subjective or lacking in verifiable deliverables, allowing criminals to inflate invoices and hide the genuine flow of illicit funds.

Such arrangements enable layering by shuffling and mingling tainted proceeds across multiple accounts and payment channels. Because schools and universities frequently process large, high-value transactions (for example, for construction projects or international student fees), criminals also exploit vendor impersonation or compromised email accounts to reroute funds under the guise of institutional payments, capitalizing on the education sector’s known vulnerabilities . Enforcement challenges are further amplified by the social respect afforded to schools and the assumption that nonprofit educational initiatives merit minimal scrutiny, limiting oversight of beneficial ownership, cross-border transfers, and irregular donor activity.

It involves transferring cryptocurrency from an initial address and distributing it across numerous new addresses in small amounts (micro-transactions) over many hops, creating a complex web that frustrates investigators . Many launderers use automated scripts or specialized software to generate hundreds of fresh addresses, each receiving small increments of the total balance .

If the funds stem from a crypto exchange hack or similar incident, criminals often initiate a peel chain immediately to break the direct trail, complicating both investigations and exchange-based monitoring . A typical sequence includes:
- Receiving a large sum of cryptocurrency into a wallet controlled by the launderer.
- Sending repeated micro-transactions to newly generated addresses, incrementally “peeling off” smaller portions of the funds.
- Involving a potentially vast number of wallets, each holding only a fraction of the original amount.
- Periodically moving “peeled” amounts to exchanges, mixers, or other conversion services to obtain fiat.
- Potentially continuing additional peel chains or consolidating leftover balances into centralized wallets once laundering is deemed sufficient.

Notable examples of peel chains have surfaced in large-scale hacks, such as the 2016 Bitfinex breach and the 2018 Bithumb hack, where criminals laundered digital assets through dozens of transfers to obscure the true source of funds . By peeling off smaller amounts, launderers reduce the likelihood of triggering automated anti-money laundering (AML) flags, as each individual transaction generally appears less suspicious. Over time, these repeated small transfers—resembling layers of an onion—significantly complicate forensic tracing and compliance oversight, underscoring the importance of enhanced monitoring and blockchain analytics solutions for detection .","Launderers typically exploit peel chains to break links between illicit funds and their origins by transferring cryptocurrency in countless micro-transactions across newly generated addresses, minimizing suspicion while frustrating investigators.

Such underground establishments seldom require customer identification, enabling large cash moves to occur with little documentation. Organized crime groups often protect or manage these rings, using them both to launder money and to finance other criminal operations with minimal traceability . In some instances, launderers mirror tactics seen in regulated markets—such as buying winning tickets from genuine bettors at a premium or forging receipts—and present these as legitimate payouts . Certain operators or facilitators also rely on underground banks to provide funds for high-value wagers, obscuring the original source of capital and circumventing cross-border controls . In the absence of reliable oversight or licensing, these illicit gambling networks grant criminals substantial anonymity and create ideal conditions for layering and consolidating criminal proceeds under the cover of gambling profits.","Adversaries typically exploit unregulated gambling venues to introduce illicit funds under minimal oversight, commingling criminal proceeds with legitimate wagers and employing layering measures—such as purchasing winning bets from genuine gamblers—to mask the true origins of their capital.",2025-04-02T13:25:50.485747+00:00,2025-04-02T13:25:50.485747+00:00,2.1,True,attack-pattern--2f77e99c-92a3-43f3-ae65-ec012c38b0f2,Unlicensed Gambling; Illegal Gambling Dens,"[
