In the context of AMLTRIX’s adversarial threat model, these activities extend beyond the traditional stages of placement, layering, and integration to encompass early infiltration (access facilitation), operational evasion, concealment mechanisms, and post-integration asset protection—recognizing that criminals can reuse or cycle between these phases as they adapt to avoid detection.",,2025-04-02T13:25:44.863577+00:00,2025-04-02T13:25:44.863577+00:00,2.1,False,,,"[
