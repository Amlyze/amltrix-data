## [Access Facilitation](https://framework.amltrix.com/tactics/ML.TA0004)

**Description:**
Access facilitation is the process of establishing reliable entry points into legitimate or less-regulated financial avenues with minimal oversight that could expose illicit transactions. By exploiting regulatory ambiguities or weak compliance regimes, adversaries secure channels to deposit, transfer, and store funds without raising suspicion. These channels may include partnerships with complicit intermediaries, cultivation of professional or personal connections, or use of informal networks to limit the likelihood of intensive scrutiny. Securing and maintaining these reliable pathways remains a core strategic objective, as it ensures that criminals can continue to move illicit assets across financial systems with limited disruption. Undetected access facilitation lays the groundwork for subsequent steps in the laundering process, allowing adversaries to build complexity and concealment around their illegal proceeds.

## [Integration](https://framework.amltrix.com/tactics/ML.TA0009)

**Description:**
**Integration**, often referred to as the final stage of money laundering, where illicitly acquired and extensively layered funds are embedded into legitimate economic activities, rendering their criminal origins indistinguishable from lawful wealth. After undergoing multiple complex transactions to obscure the source, adversaries channel these funds into mainstream investments, real estate, legitimate business operations, or financial instruments, ensuring that illicit proceeds appear fully legitimate and freely usable without arousing suspicion.

A critical dimension of integration is the deliberate **repatriation of illicit proceeds**—often transferring funds back into specific jurisdictions after they have been legitimized or cleaned abroad. Criminals execute this repatriation phase when they judge layering sufficient, seeking practical advantages such as enhanced control, ease of access, and exploitation of familiar regulatory or commercial environments. By returning integrated funds to jurisdictions of operational influence or strategic importance, adversaries leverage local networks, infrastructure, and business operations, solidifying their territorial control and direct oversight of previously concealed assets.

Distinct from merely obscuring asset origins, repatriation explicitly involves strategically timed cross-border movements designed to consolidate control and maximize operational utility in familiar or favorable regulatory contexts. For AML professionals, the integration and repatriation stages present particular challenges, requiring heightened vigilance and international coordination to identify transfers with subtly disguised histories, especially upon reentry into jurisdictions with weaker oversight or substantial criminal influence.

## [Establishing Funds Collection](https://framework.amltrix.com/tactics/TF.TA0012)

**Description:**
This tactic focuses on securing a reliable and sustainable avenue for gathering financial resources, rather than the immediate act of acquiring funds. This involves identifying and setting up systems that facilitate the ongoing inflow of money, whether through legitimate means like charitable donations and business ventures or illicit activities such as extortion or criminal networks.

Legal channels can include:
 - Charities and NPOs: Terrorist organizations can exploit legitimate charities and NPOs to raise and move funds. They may pose as legitimate entities, exploit existing entities as conduits, or divert funds intended for legitimate purposes.
 - Crowdfunding: Terrorist organizations can use crowdfunding platforms to solicit donations from a large number of people. This can be done through dedicated platforms, social media, or other online channels.
 - Businesses: Terrorist organizations can establish or invest in legitimate businesses to generate income. These businesses can range from small shops to large corporations.

Illegal channels can include:
 - Criminal activities: Terrorist organizations can engage in a wide range of criminal activities to generate funds, including drug trafficking, smuggling, extortion, and kidnapping for ransom.
 - State sponsorship: Some terrorist organizations receive funding from states. This funding can be provided directly or indirectly, through the provision of weapons, training, or other support.

Once a terrorist organization has established a funds collection channel, it can then use it to collect funds.

## [Illicit Acquisition](https://framework.amltrix.com/tactics/ML.TA0001)

**Description:**
**Acquisition** and sustainment of illicit funds encompasses both the foundational stage of generating criminal wealth through predicate offenses and the strategic reinvestment of illicit proceeds back into ongoing criminal enterprises. Initially, adversaries accumulate illicit capital via profitable unlawful activities—including fraud, corruption, narcotics trafficking, cybercrime, and theft—forming the economic base that facilitates subsequent money laundering operations. These illicit funds, when successfully concealed at inception, significantly complicate downstream tracing efforts and enable deeper infiltration into legitimate financial systems.

Beyond mere acquisition, adversaries actively reinvest and channel funds back into sustaining and expanding their criminal networks. By recycling illicit proceeds to cover operational costs, procure resources, upgrade capabilities, and finance new illicit ventures, criminals ensure a continuous, self-perpetuating financial loop. Cyclical reinvestment significantly strengthens criminal infrastructure, facilitating increasingly sophisticated methods of generating and laundering further illicit proceeds. AML professionals must, therefore, not only target initial acquisition channels but also understand and disrupt this cyclical financial flow. Effective detection relies heavily on identifying suspicious reinvestment patterns, ongoing irregular asset flows, and the continuous reappearance of previously identified illicit funds within criminal operational contexts.

## [Layering](https://framework.amltrix.com/tactics/ML.TA0007)

**Description:**
Layering is characterized by a series of complex, often repeated, financial movements designed to obscure the criminal origin of funds. Adversaries reduce the strength of the audit trail by shifting assets through multiple accounts, entities, or jurisdictions, making it difficult for investigators to link them to the initial crime. Each layer further distances the funds from their illegal source, often relying on rapid transfers, currency exchanges, and sophisticated accounting maneuvers to create an intricate transactional web. Success at this stage greatly increases the difficulty of drawing direct connections between the funds and their underlying unlawful activities, paving the way for their gradual absorption into the legitimate financial system.

### Related Techniques

## [Concealment Mechanisms](https://framework.amltrix.com/tactics/ML.TA0002)

**Description:**
Establishment of concealment mechanisms involves constructing or employing structures, entities, or organizational layers specifically designed to mask the illicit origin or true ownership of criminal proceeds. By introducing distance between the assets and the underlying crime, adversaries minimize the outward visibility of potentially suspicious transactions. These mechanisms often span multiple jurisdictions and incorporate legal or corporate complexities—such as shell companies or layers of nominee ownership—to hinder straightforward tracing of beneficial owners. Detecting these concealment arrangements is a priority for AML efforts, as they can seamlessly blend with routine corporate or financial activities, enabling criminals to embed their illicit funds behind a veneer of legitimacy. Once entrenched, these deceptive structures underpin subsequent laundering stages by offering seemingly lawful gateways for further layering, transfers, or eventual integration into the legitimate financial system.

## [Money Movement](https://framework.amltrix.com/tactics/TF.TA0010)

**Description:**
This tactic focuses on the strategies and techniques used to transfer funds in a covert and efficient manner. It includes utilizing both formal financial institutions, such as banks and remittance services, and informal channels, such as hawala networks, digital currencies, and physical cash smuggling. The goal is to obscure the origin and destination of funds, making it difficult to track and disrupt financial flows. 

Financial institutions monitor transactions for any unusual money flows, especially those involving remittance services, international wire transfers, digital currencies, and other financial channels that can be exploited. Behavioral indicators largely overlap with indicators of money laundering. 

**Examples**:
 - Cash Smuggling: This involves physically transporting large sums of cash across borders.
 - Money Service Businesses: These offer quick and relatively anonymous ways to transfer funds globally.
 - Formal Banking Systems: While facing stricter controls, banks can still be exploited for money transfers.

## [Placement](https://framework.amltrix.com/tactics/ML.TA0006)

**Description:**
Placement marks the first point at which illicit funds converge with legitimate financial or commercial systems. The primary objective at this stage is to transform suspicious proceeds into transaction records that appear lawful, reducing the immediate visibility of criminal origins. Once placed, these assets can be maneuvered with less scrutiny, paving the way for deeper layers of laundering activity.

By embedding funds into accounts or enterprises that appear to operate legitimately, adversaries blend illicit assets into a broader, more conventional financial stream. Though details vary, the common thread is a calculated effort to ensure the funds are accepted in routine financial or commercial processes. This foundation increases the likelihood that subsequent layering schemes will evade detection.

From an AML perspective, placement is often considered the most vulnerable phase for criminals, as sudden or large-scale inflows may trigger red flags. Monitoring atypical deposit patterns or abrupt changes in account behavior serves as a frontline defense. However, once adversaries successfully navigate this phase, the funds become more intricately woven into the legitimate economy, complicating later detection efforts.

## [Asset Protection](https://framework.amltrix.com/tactics/ML.TA0010)

**Description:**
**Asset protection** denotes the safeguarding and preservation of illicitly acquired wealth against detection, seizure, or legal repercussions, especially once criminal proceeds have entered legitimate financial ecosystems. By strategically dispersing, restructuring, or relocating assets across multiple jurisdictions, financial instruments, or protective structures, adversaries reduce vulnerability to coordinated enforcement actions, complicating investigative tracing and minimizing the risk of asset freezing or confiscation. Additionally, a key aspect of effective asset protection involves proactive liquidity management—maintaining the ability to swiftly mobilize, convert, or redeploy illicit assets in response to emerging threats, investigative actions, or operational opportunities.

To ensure both long-term security and short-term flexibility, adversaries deliberately maintain illicit funds in readily convertible forms or highly liquid instruments, preventing assets from becoming locked in illiquid investments or prolonged holding patterns. Sudden shifts in transactional patterns, frequent cross-jurisdictional conversions, and carefully timed asset liquidations typify sophisticated asset protection and liquidity management strategies. When successfully implemented, these combined approaches provide criminals not only with long-term financial security and reduced susceptibility to law enforcement scrutiny but also decisive operational agility, enabling rapid adjustments to investigative pressures or changing financial environments. For AML professionals, effective detection of these tactics necessitates vigilant cross-border collaboration, sophisticated transaction monitoring, and an in-depth understanding of complex corporate ownership structures and transactional dynamics to unmask the layered beneficial ownership and fluid movement of criminal assets.
