## [Over-the-Counter (OTC) Trading](https://framework.amltrix.com/services-products/PS0001)

**Description:**
A service enabling direct transactions in financial instruments between two parties outside formal exchanges. It includes trading in derivatives, stocks, bonds, and digital currencies and is typically facilitated by specialized brokers or OTC desks.
