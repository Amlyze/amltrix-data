# Mitigations

## [Country Risk Assessment](https://framework.amltrix.com/mitigations/M0001)

**Description:**
A structured procedural measure where financial institutions systematically categorize and assign risk ratings to jurisdictions based on corruption levels, regulatory robustness, sanctions status, and other relevant indicators. This enables targeted allocation of compliance resources and intensified due diligence for higher-risk geographies. By adjusting scrutiny and monitoring according to country risk ratings, FIs improve their ability to detect suspicious activities, mitigate potential misuse of services by criminals, and align with a risk-based approach for AML/CFT compliance.

## [Customer Due Diligence (CDD)](https://framework.amltrix.com/mitigations/M0003)

**Description:**
Customer Due Diligence (CDD) is a core procedural control requiring financial institutions to identify and verify key details about their customers (including beneficial owners) at the outset of a business relationship and on an ongoing basis. By collecting and verifying personal and corporate information (for example, via official documents, digital identity checks, or biometric methods), CDD prevents anonymous or misrepresented account usage and clarifies who truly owns or controls an account or legal entity. This transparency underpins effective AML/CFT measures by enabling enhanced transaction monitoring, detection of unusual or suspicious activity, and targeted risk management. CDD’s practical relevance lies in its requirement for financial institutions to maintain accurate, up-to-date customer data so they can promptly spot red flags (such as atypical transactions or changes in ownership), fulfill mandatory reporting obligations, and conduct timely investigations when necessary. As a result, CDD provides a foundational layer that helps ensure compliance, safeguards institutional reputations, and diminishes opportunities for illicit abuse of financial products and services.

## [Suspicious Activity Reporting (SARs/STRs)](https://framework.amltrix.com/mitigations/M0018)

**Description:**
Suspicious Activity Reporting (SARs/STRs) is a procedural and technological control obliging financial institutions (FIs) to identify, assess, and document transactions or account activities that appear unusual or potentially linked to illicit conduct, and then promptly submit standardized reports to their respective financial intelligence units or authorities. It serves an explicit AML/CFT function by driving early detection and escalation of possible money laundering, terrorist financing, or other unlawful activities. In practice, FIs integrate automated surveillance systems and well-defined reporting protocols to generate alerts, train staff to recognize behavioral red flags, and establish clear processes for escalating suspicious activity to designated officers. This increases transparency in the financial sector, supports regulatory obligations, and enhances industry-wide collaboration with investigative authorities. As highlighted in record 1480, effective SAR/STR frameworks often rely on standardized reporting modules and management oversight mechanisms (e.g., ratio of filed reports to cases). Further, record 1426 underscores the need for mandatory staff escalation procedures and clear reporting channels to ensure that unusual activities are properly investigated. Finally, record 938 emphasizes the critical role played by frontline FIs in screening transactions, filing suspicious transaction reports, and sharing relevant intelligence with authorities in a timely manner.

## [Third-Party Risk Management](https://framework.amltrix.com/mitigations/M0006)

**Description:**
Third-Party Risk Management is an organizational and procedural control that safeguards financial institutions against money laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) vulnerabilities introduced by external vendors, service providers, or other partners. Its primary AML/CFT purpose is to ensure that any third party’s activities, products, or systems meet the institution’s compliance standards, thereby preventing criminal exploitation and maintaining oversight of outsourced operations. In practice, FIs implement ongoing due diligence at the onboarding stage—reviewing the third party’s AML track record, compliance practices, and financial stability—and extend these controls through periodic reviews, audits, and established governance procedures. This helps detect hidden ownership, mitigate risks from large or unexplained third-party transactions, and guarantee an effective response if suspicious behavior arises. By clearly outlining roles, responsibilities, and reporting obligations through service-level agreements and continuous monitoring, Third-Party Risk Management supports a robust control environment and protects the institution’s AML/CFT integrity throughout the vendor lifecycle.

## [Transaction Monitoring](https://framework.amltrix.com/mitigations/M0004)

**Description:**
Transaction Monitoring is a key detective measure enabling financial institutions to continuously track and evaluate customer transactions across accounts, products, and channels, including digital assets. It relies on rules-based scenarios, advanced analytics, and alert-generation mechanisms to identify activities deviating from a customer’s established risk profile. Detected alerts are escalated through well-defined pathways for investigation, helping determine whether the activity is potentially money laundering, terrorist financing, or another illicit scheme. This control is most effective when supported by accurate, comprehensive data, robust scenario coverage (frequently tuned and enhanced to capture emerging typologies), and a clear escalation process for compliance or law enforcement referrals. Within an FI, it typically integrates with case management systems to document and streamline investigations, ensuring timely alerts and, where necessary, regulatory reporting. By harnessing ongoing oversight, data governance, and scenario refinement, transaction monitoring helps mitigate illicit financial risks, strengthens institutional AML/CFT frameworks, and supports prompt detection and intervention in suspicious transactions.

## [Sanctions & Watchlist Screening](https://framework.amltrix.com/mitigations/M0005)

**Description:**
Sanctions & Watchlist Screening is a combined procedural and technological measure by which financial institutions identify and restrict transactions or relationships involving sanctioned or high-risk individuals, entities, or jurisdictions. It systematically compares customer and transaction data against official sanctions lists (e.g., UN, OFAC, EU), PEP records, adverse media sources, and internal watchlists. This process operates in real time or via scheduled batch checks, flagging or blocking potential matches to prevent unauthorized or illegal transactions. Integrated with KYC/CDD and transaction monitoring workflows, it enables compliance teams to investigate alerts, apply measures such as account freezing or transaction rejection, and perform enhanced due diligence. By disrupting illicit flows and ensuring compliance with AML/CFT standards, it helps protect the institution’s operations from misuse by sanctioned or high-risk parties and mitigates legal and reputational risks.

## [Service Restriction](https://framework.amltrix.com/mitigations/M0023)

**Description:**
Service Restriction is a procedural and technological control through which financial institutions limit, block, or withdraw access to higher-risk products, services, or transaction channels to reduce potential money laundering or terrorist financing misuse. By leveraging predefined criteria—such as suspending high-risk accounts, restricting certain transfers (particularly to high-risk jurisdictions), or allowing only basic banking services for customers under enhanced monitoring—institutions constrain opportunities for criminals to hide or transfer illicit funds. This measure bolsters transactional transparency, ensures additional checks before service reactivation, and enhances investigative capabilities by narrowing the scope of suspicious activity. Typically triggered by specific risk indicators, Service Restriction is embedded in an FI’s AML/CFT framework to promptly contain misuse, strengthen oversight, and prevent escalated ML/TF activities.

## [Cash Transaction Reporting (CTR)](https://framework.amltrix.com/mitigations/M0007)

**Description:**
Cash Transaction Reporting (CTR) is a procedural AML control that obliges financial institutions (FIs) to identify and report large or threshold-based cash transactions to relevant authorities. By requiring timely disclosures of significant in-branch or electronic cash movements, CTR creates a reliable audit trail and strengthens FIs’ ability to detect and disrupt criminal strategies involving bulk cash, structuring, or rapid layering. Within an FI’s operating environment, staff or automated systems track cash inflows and outflows, flag those above the set reporting threshold, and then submit CTRs. This process improves transparency, helps investigators map illicit fund flows, and deters criminals by making it more difficult to conceal high-value or repetitive cash activity.

### Related Techniques

## [Do Not Mitigate](https://framework.amltrix.com/mitigations/M0010)

**Description:**
This classification applies when introducing additional AML/CFT measures could unintentionally increase illicit misuse risks or hinder legitimate transactions beyond the expected benefits. In such scenarios, financial institutions refrain from implementing new controls and instead rely on risk-based approaches to preserve financial inclusion and operational efficiency. By choosing not to introduce further measures, FIs avoid inadvertently pushing illicit activity into unregulated channels or placing undue burdens on low-risk clients. However, they must still ensure existing regulatory obligations are met, regularly assess changing risks, and confirm that the decision not to mitigate aligns with broader compliance and business objectives.

## [OSINT & External Source Verification](https://framework.amltrix.com/mitigations/M0021)

**Description:**
OSINT & External Source Verification is a procedural and investigative measure enabling financial institutions to use publicly accessible information—such as government registers, news outlets, external databases, and social media—to validate the identities, business activities, and beneficial ownership of customers. By systematically cross-referencing internal records with external sources throughout onboarding and ongoing monitoring, institutions can detect discrepancies, hidden ownership tiers, adverse media, and suspicious patterns more rapidly. This enhances due diligence, improves the accuracy of risk assessments, and bolsters investigations, ultimately reducing the possibility of criminal entities exploiting financial services for money laundering or terrorist financing.

## [Client Relationship Termination](https://framework.amltrix.com/mitigations/M0029)

**Description:**
Client Relationship Termination is a procedural measure used by financial institutions (FIs) to end all formal dealings with a customer after confirming that the customer’s money laundering or terrorist financing risks cannot be managed within acceptable thresholds. Its primary AML/CFT purpose is to remove any remaining channels for illicit fund placement or layering that might persist when enhanced due diligence, ongoing monitoring, or other remedial actions fail to mitigate high risks. In practice, this control is typically enacted after repeated or escalating attempts—such as requesting additional information—remain unfulfilled or the customer’s overall risk profile becomes unmanageable. By ceasing the relationship, the FI both disrupts criminal misuse of its services and protects itself from further reputational or regulatory harm. Thorough internal review and senior management escalation generally precede the decision, ensuring that termination is applied only after other safeguards prove insufficient or the client remains non-responsive to key AML/CFT requirements.

## [Internal Reporting Mechanisms](https://framework.amltrix.com/mitigations/M0025)

**Description:**
Internal Reporting Mechanisms are procedural controls that establish formal, secure, and confidential channels (such as hotlines or portals) for employees to quickly escalate potential money laundering or terrorist financing concerns. Drawing on insights emphasizing a culture of transparency (Record 2065) and the critical function of whistleblower safeguards (Record 981), these mechanisms incorporate clear escalation protocols and privacy protections to encourage staff to flag suspicious activities or unethical conduct early. In financial institutions, this enables timely sharing of relevant information with compliance teams or committees, aiding swift analysis and resolution of AML/CFT risks. By fostering openness and ensuring whistleblower protection, Internal Reporting Mechanisms bolster accountability, strengthen investigative efforts and reinforce ongoing adherence to AML/CFT obligations.

## [Trade Monitoring](https://framework.amltrix.com/mitigations/M0026)

**Description:**
Trade Monitoring is a structured detective control adopted by financial institutions to systematically scrutinize trade flows and related documentation for price manipulation, misinvoicing, and other suspicious patterns indicative of money laundering or terrorist financing. By verifying trade counterparties, cross-checking shipping and invoice details for inconsistencies (e.g., atypical quantities, false valuations), and assessing the legitimacy of goods and beneficiaries—particularly for high-risk commodities such as precious metals—financial institutions can more effectively detect and disrupt illicit financial flows attempting to exploit trade channels. Leveraging data analytics and comparative techniques (such as unit-price or anomaly detection), this measure strengthens internal AML/CFT investigations and enhances transparency around cross-border and high-risk transactions in international commerce, ultimately mitigating the risk of trade-based money laundering schemes.

### Related Techniques

- [Fraud](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144) — Scrutinize shipping, customs, and trade documentation for inconsistencies between billed amounts and the actual goods or services delivered. Focus on re-invoicing patterns, mismatched delivery dates, or nonexistent shipments that may signal fraudulent claims. By cross-checking declared values and product information against official trade data, financial institutions can detect artificially inflated or entirely fictitious transactions used to create illicit funds through fraud.
- [Arms Trafficking](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0143.002) — Review trade finance documents and shipping details for evidence of mislabeled or dual-use items, especially consignments nominally declared as "mechanical parts" or "industrial tools." Compare product descriptions, invoiced values, and shipping routes against known arms trafficking patterns to detect hidden weapons transfers.
- [Commodity Trafficking](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0143) — Scrutinize trade documentation, invoices, and shipping details for inconsistencies in declared goods, unusual or manipulated pricing, mislabeling of commodities, or transit through high-risk jurisdictions known for smuggling. By applying anomaly detection to invoice values and shipping routes, financial institutions can identify trade-based money laundering tactics commonly used in commodity trafficking.
- [Drug Trade](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0142) — Scrutinize the shipping documents and invoices for under- or over-invoicing of chemical precursors, pill presses, or other pharmaceutical inputs. Compare declared cargo contents with shipping details and current market pricing to detect irregularities. Investigate complex routing of goods often used to camouflage illicit drug production or distribution activities.

## [Quality Assurance and Control](https://framework.amltrix.com/mitigations/M0028)

**Description:**
Quality Assurance and Control is a procedural measure that ensures an FI’s AML/CFT program remains reliable, consistent, and aligned with evolving regulatory requirements. It involves structured, routine reviews of existing controls, regular testing (e.g., sampling transaction monitoring outputs or verifying data feeds), and maintaining feedback loops to identify and resolve procedural gaps. By embedding self-assessment or internal reviews into daily operations, institutions can stay vigilant to weaknesses, confirm that compliance activities (such as staff training completion) are tracked, and continuously refine their AML/CFT processes. This proactive approach preserves the effectiveness of risk detection, fosters robust oversight, and fortifies the institution’s overall defense against money laundering and terrorism financing threats.

- [Digital Document & Transaction Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0012.002) — Maintain a robust review process that regularly samples electronic transaction records, comparing them with original source files or external confirmations to detect unexplained discrepancies. By systematically verifying data accuracy and integrity, institutions can quickly uncover attempts to tamper with or falsify digital documents.
- [Automated Transaction Systems](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0026) — Implement continuous QA reviews and tuning of AML rules to reduce false negatives in detecting repetitive or scheduled small-value transfers. Run controlled scenario tests to pinpoint weaknesses in threshold-based alerts and incorporate new typologies linked to automated layering. Ensure that data from diverse payment channels is consistently validated and reconciled for accuracy.

## [Enterprise-Wide Risk Assessment](https://framework.amltrix.com/mitigations/M0030)

**Description:**
An Enterprise-Wide Risk Assessment (EWRA) is a strategic, organization-wide measure that identifies, analyzes, and monitors money laundering, terrorist financing, and related financial crime vulnerabilities across all products, services, customer segments, and geographies. By systematically reviewing both internal processes and external risk factors, financial institutions calibrate controls and resource allocations in proportion to the evolving ML/TF threats they face. This operational approach involves: (1) gathering and synthesizing relevant risk intelligence; (2) assessing inherent and residual risks for each line of business; (3) tailoring and enhancing AML/CFT measures based on the identified risk profile; and (4) maintaining a cycle of dynamic review and senior management oversight. The EWRA ultimately fosters informed, risk-based decisions, ensuring more robust detection, disruption, and prevention of illicit financial activity at an enterprise level.

### Related Techniques
- [Knowledge Compartmentalization](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0149) — Explicitly assess organizational structures and internal data flows to identify areas where operational silos may mask connected criminal activity. By mapping how information moves—and sometimes fails to move—between business units, financial institutions can develop cross-functional oversight processes that hinder attempts to launder funds by limiting any single team’s view.
