Physical tokens issued by casinos representing defined monetary values for wagering in table games or redeeming for cash.

### Related Techniques
- [Casino Mule Networks](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0011.003) — - Criminals purchase chips with cash derived from illicit sources, spreading transactions across multiple individuals (mules) to evade reporting triggers.
- Chips can be passed between different patrons or consolidated into higher-value denominations, masking the original source of funds.
- Minimal or no gambling play is needed before redeeming chips, enabling the quick conversion of illicit cash into a casino-issued instrument perceived as legitimate winnings.
- [Underground Gambling](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107.007) — - Underground gambling rings issue chips instead of directly handling cash, allowing criminals to convert illicit currency into chips without raising suspicion.
- After minimal or staged betting, criminals redeem chips as gambling winnings, obscuring the origin of the funds.
- The informal nature of these venues typically lacks robust customer identification or transaction logging, enabling criminals to present their payouts as legitimate gains.
- [Money Mule Exploitation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0011) — - As part of 'Casino Mule Networks,' criminals instruct mules to purchase chips with illicit funds, engage in minimal wagering, and redeem the chips for seemingly legitimate winnings.
- This process reintroduces illicit capital as casino payouts, complicating the paper trail and obscuring the true origin of the funds.
- [Chip Dumping](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107.003) — - In physical casinos, illicit funds are exchanged for chips and then purposely lost to an accomplice at the table.
- The accomplice redeems the chips as legitimate gambling proceeds, obscuring the illicit source.
- Repeated or structured chip losses complicate investigations, making each transaction appear as ordinary gameplay rather than orchestrated collusion.
- [Junket-based Casino Transfers](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107.004) — - Junket VIP patrons receive high-value chips purchased with unclear funding sources under private junket credit arrangements.
- Criminals can convert chips back to cash or pass them between accomplices, enabling illicit funds to reappear as legitimate gambling winnings.
- [Casino Chip Conversions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107.006) — - Criminals exchange illicit cash for casino chips, converting physical funds into a recognized casino asset.
- They conduct minimal or staged betting, then redeem the chips for purported 'winnings,' masking the original source of funds.
- Opaque chip transactions help criminals disguise illicit proceeds as legitimate gambling payouts.
- [Migrant Smuggling](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0059) — - Criminals introduce large volumes of illicit cash into casinos by purchasing chips.
- After minimal gambling activity, these chips are redeemed as "winnings," obscuring the original source of the funds.
- This process converts bulk smuggling proceeds into seemingly legitimate payouts, hindering investigators' ability to link the money back to human smuggling.
- [Immediate Cash Conversion](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0105) — - Criminals purchase gaming chips using illicit proceeds and then immediately redeem them for cash with minimal betting activity.
- This rapid cash-out effectively replaces a traceable deposit (e.g., bank transfer or card payment at the casino) with anonymous physical currency.
- High-volume casino operations make it more challenging to detect the true origin of funds.
- [Counterfeit Currency](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0092) — - Criminals purchase casino chips with counterfeit bills, converting forged currency into gaming tokens.
- Winnings or cashouts from these chips appear legitimate, obscuring the counterfeit origin of funds.
- Casinos with insufficient scrutiny of incoming banknotes facilitate this exchange, allowing large sums of fake money to enter the financial system as seemingly valid payouts.
- [In-Person Gambling Imitation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107) — - Criminals purchase chips using illicit funds, make a small volume of bets or offset wagers, then redeem the chips as legitimate payouts.
- Because chips are tracked as standard gambling transactions, the funds' illicit origins are concealed behind normal casino activity.
- The resulting receipts or checks label these proceeds as lawful gambling winnings.

## [Virtual Goods](https://framework.amltrix.com/instruments/IN0002)

**Description:**
Digitally tradable items or assets found in online environments, encompassing in-game items, digital skins, token-based collectibles, and virtual real estate. These items can be bought, sold, or exchanged in specialized online marketplaces or token-based platforms, often carrying real-world monetary value.

### Related Techniques
- [E-commerce & Marketplace Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0028) — - Perpetrators list intangible digital items (e.g., downloadable software, in-game assets) at inflated prices, then repeatedly 'purchase' these goods with illicit funds.
- The nominally legitimate commerce structure makes it challenging to distinguish criminal money flows from ordinary customer transactions, thus adding a layer of complexity to AML efforts.
- [Child Exploitation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0058.003) — - Offenders accept payments or funnel illegal proceeds through in-game digital assets or online platform collectibles, taking advantage of the ease of transferring these items with minimal oversight.
- They can then convert virtual goods back into real currency or different digital assets, further complicating the traceability of funds derived from child exploitation.
- [Virtual Worlds](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0066) — - Criminals purchase or earn virtual items (e.g., skins, digital collectibles) using illicit funds, then resell them in secondary markets or via peer-to-peer transactions, masking the illegitimate origin behind seemingly normal gameplay trades.
- The perceived legitimacy of in-game assets and minimal identity checks in many trading hubs allow offenders to artificially inflate or conceal the value of these goods.
- Repeated buying and selling of digital items add layers of complexity, hindering investigators’ ability to link final proceeds back to the original illicit source.
- [In-Game Currency & Microtransaction Exploits](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0066.003) — - Criminals purchase or receive in-game items (e.g., digital skins, rare collectibles) using illicit funds or stolen payment methods.
- They then resell these items on online marketplaces at manipulated or inflated prices, receiving payment in real currency, cryptocurrencies, or gift cards.
- Repeated resales in small increments obscure the provenance of the funds, blending illicit proceeds with routine gaming transactions.
- [Metaverse-based Asset Transfers](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0066.001) — - Criminals convert stolen tokens into metaverse-specific virtual goods (e.g., virtual real estate, wearables) to obscure the funds’ illegal origin. By carrying out these purchases in a high-volume marketplace, they insert additional transactional layers.
- The intangible nature of these assets and the cross-border reach of metaverse platforms diminish straightforward oversight, allowing illicit funds to be rapidly moved or resold with minimal scrutiny.
- When these virtual goods are quickly resold to legitimate buyers, criminals receive new tokens that appear unrelated to the initial illicit holdings, further distancing the funds from their criminal origins.
- [Cross-Platform Trading](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0066.002) — - Criminals acquire or sell in-game items, characters, or entire accounts across grey-market RMT platforms to layer illicit funds without using official in-game marketplaces.
- Because these digital assets are tradable outside legitimate channels, they can be exchanged multiple times across different gaming environments, obscuring the original source of value.
- Minimal or non-existent identity verification on many RMT sites enables rapid ownership transfers and hampers straightforward AML oversight.

Negotiable instruments instructing a bank to pay a specified sum from the issuer’s account to the payee on demand. Checks may be paper-based or digital and are widely used for personal and business transactions.

### Related Techniques
- [Black Market Peso Exchange](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0013.005) — - After receiving physical US dollars from criminal sources, the peso broker may deposit them into an account and issue checks payable to exporters.
- Checks labeled as legitimate business payments disguise the true origin of funds, complicating the detection of illicit proceeds.
- This layer of separation (cash-to-account-to-check) aids in obscuring the criminal source behind ordinary commercial transactions.
- [Bearer Instruments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0042) — Criminals exploit bearer checks by anonymously transferring or cashing them without needing identification or endorsement, thereby obscuring the origin and ownership of illicit funds.
- [Forging or Altering Financial Instruments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0126) — - Criminals physically or digitally overwrite amounts, modify payee details, or forge signatures on checks.
- These altered checks then enter clearing processes as if genuine, masking the true origin or purpose of funds.
- The apparent legitimacy of check-based transactions makes detecting tampering more challenging for standard AML reviews.
- [Document Forgery](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0012) — - By altering payee information, amounts, or signatures on checks, criminals can fabricate legitimate-looking payments from forged documents.
- This technique secures unauthorized disbursements from accounts, allowing launderers to transfer and integrate illicit proceeds under the guise of routine transactions.
- [Fictitious Payroll](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0068) — Some employers still issue paper or electronic checks for payroll. Criminals insert ghost employees or inflate wages, then write checks payable to personal or controlled accounts:

- Fraudsters can deposit or cash these checks, integrating illicit proceeds into the financial system under the guise of regular compensation.
- [Junket-based Casino Transfers](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107.004) — Junket operators or complicit casinos lend funds to gamblers through negotiable checks, enabling the disguised transfer of illicit proceeds that appear as legitimate gaming-related transactions.
- [Casino Mule Networks](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0011.003) — - Casinos often issue checks upon chip redemption, effectively transforming illicit cash or chip balances into what appear to be legitimate gambling proceeds.
- The rapid redemption of chips for checks—without substantial gameplay—helps conceal the funds’ criminal origins.
- Checks can then be deposited into bank accounts or further circulated, benefiting from the perception of legitimate 'casino winnings.'
- [Charitable and Non-Profit Organizations](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0019) — - Non-profit organizations frequently accept checks as donations, enabling criminals to funnel illicit proceeds under the guise of legitimate philanthropic contributions.
- Complicit staff or lax verification processes can prevent proper scrutiny of check donors, allowing criminals to use multiple checks from different sources or accounts to layer funds.
- Once deposited in the charity’s account, the illicit origins become obscured by the perceived legitimacy of charitable donations.
- [Name Alteration](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0023.002) — - Criminals physically or digitally alter the payee name on checks, removing or changing it to match their newly assumed identity.
- By depositing these altered checks into accounts opened under the fabricated or modified name, they circumvent watchlist or negative due diligence checks tied to their true identities.
- This misuse directly exploits the reliance on accurate payee identification in check-clearing processes, allowing illicit funds to flow without triggering red flags associated with the original beneficiary.
- [Remote Deposit Capture](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0117) — - Criminals leverage remote deposit capture to submit physically altered or stolen checks from locations away from a branch, sidestepping face-to-face scrutiny.
- They often deposit near-identical checks sequentially into multiple accounts, quickly moving funds before financial institutions detect discrepancies.
- The automated, non-face-to-face nature of remote deposit simplifies introducing counterfeit or duplicated checks into the system.
- [Misrepresentation of Fund Purpose](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0040) — - Offenders issue checks under misleading narratives, citing reasons like 'charitable donations' or 'service payments' to legitimize the transfer.  
- The memo line and accompanying records provide an opportunity to falsely characterize the transaction’s purpose, obscuring illicit sources of funds.
- [Expense Report Fraud](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144.006) — - Companies often issue checks for employee expense reimbursements.
- By submitting bogus receipts, perpetrators secure checks for non-existent or over-reported outlays, then deposit or cash them, integrating illicit proceeds into their personal finances under the guise of valid reimbursements.
- [Unlicensed Real Estate Brokerage](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0133) — - Criminals may use checks from unrelated third-party sources to purchase real estate through unlicensed brokers.
- These brokers typically do not perform enhanced due diligence on the check origin or payer.
- This strategy layers illicit funds from various sources, obscuring the trail and beneficial owner.
- [Fictitious Creditors](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0103) — - Companies issue checks to false creditors, recording them as normal payables in internal bookkeeping.
- The physical or electronic checks appear as legitimate business payments, helping criminals mask outflows of illicit funds.
- This method leverages the routine nature of check payments, making it harder for auditors or financial institutions to detect the deceptive transactions.
- [Arbitration Settlement Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0046) — - Criminals issue checks labeled as arbitral “settlement payments,” giving the appearance of a legitimate legal outcome.
- By presenting official or certified checks tied to staged arbitration awards, illicit funds can be deposited into the financial system with minimal suspicion, as they seem to stem from a valid judicial or quasi-judicial process.
- This mechanism bypasses typical AML alerts because supporting documentation (the ‘arbitration award’) lends credibility to otherwise dubious transfers.
- [Cheque Fraud](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144.010) — - Criminals deposit fraudulent (e.g., NSF or washed) checks into newly opened or existing accounts, exploiting float periods or delayed clearing to receive temporary credit.
- By the time these checks are flagged as worthless and returned unpaid, the illicit actors have often withdrawn or transferred the credited funds.
- Stolen checks may be chemically altered to change payee or amount details, further facilitating unauthorized withdrawals or purchases.
- [Payroll Tax Evasion](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0147.001) — - Illicit payroll funds are often disbursed through checks drawn on underreported payroll accounts or shell company accounts.
- Employees, frequently undocumented, then cash these checks at check-cashing services, bypassing deeper scrutiny by traditional banks.
- This process conceals the actual workforce size and wage disbursements, impeding accurate tracking of owed payroll taxes.
- [Third-Party Payments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0073) — - Criminals instruct unrelated third parties to issue checks from personal or business accounts on the criminal’s behalf.
- Transactions appear legitimate because the checks come from external sources, distancing the launderer from the funds.
- Using multiple payers and structuring amounts across various checks reduces flags for unusual account activity, complicating anti-money laundering oversight.
- [Electronic Gaming Machine Ticket Redemption](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0054) — - Casinos may issue checks for larger TITO redemptions, offering a credible bank-drawn instrument.
- Criminals deposit these checks into their accounts, where they appear legitimate due to the casino’s reputable status.
- The check form factor further distances the funds from their original cash source, complicating financial institution scrutiny.

- Countertrade schemes frequently use these products in reciprocal exchanges, shipping them multiple times or leaving them unclaimed.
- Such practices create convoluted paper trails that disguise true ownership and distort the declared value of transactions.
- [Sanctions Evasion](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0141) — - Sanctioned regimes often rely heavily on selling oil or other petroleum products; adversaries disguise the origin or destination of these shipments to evade restrictions.
- By forging bills of lading or commercial invoices, criminals conceal that products originate from, or are destined for, sanctioned regions.
- They then launder proceeds through trade documentation that appears to represent legitimate commodities, complicating detection by financial institutions and authorities.
- [Oil and Fuel Transaction Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0111.001) — - The physical oil or fuel shipment itself becomes the vehicle for cross-border value movement. Criminals misstate the cargo’s grade, price, or volume, creating a cover for illicit proceeds.
- Through forged bills of lading and blended fuel grades, actual shipment values are obscured, allowing perpetrators to shift significant sums under seemingly legitimate energy transactions.
- The global nature of oil markets and variable AML enforcement across jurisdictions facilitate these manipulations, making it tougher for authorities to detect the true origin and destination of profits.

- [Bond Investments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0061.004) — Criminals acquire insurance-based bond products under the names of relatives or third parties, obscuring the true beneficial owner and source of funds. By placing illicit capital within an insurance wrapper, they legitimize otherwise suspect funds. The interest or redemption proceeds then appear as regular insurance benefits, complicating efforts to trace the criminal origin of the money.
- [Insurance Annuities](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0087) — Criminals exploit annuity-style insurance policies as follows:

- They place illicit funds by overfunding premiums or making lump-sum payments (sometimes via unrelated third parties), turning cash into a policy asset with purportedly legitimate origins.
- Through partial withdrawals, policy loans, or early surrenders, criminals extract these funds as seemingly normal investment proceeds.
- The frequent surrender or transfer of policies, especially during cooling-off periods, and assigning beneficiaries to nominees obscures the true source and beneficiary of the money.
- Complicit brokers in secrecy-friendly jurisdictions facilitate cross-border transfers and ownership changes, further masking beneficial owners from AML scrutiny.
- [Captive Insurance](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0090.001) — - Criminals establish or control a captive insurer and issue policies to related parties, allowing illicit funds to enter as inflated premiums under the guise of standard insurance coverage.
- By controlling both sides of the transaction (insurer and insured), they can file fabricated or exaggerated claims, funneling funds back out as supposedly legitimate insurance payouts.
- This cycle of premium payments and claim settlements adds layering complexity, particularly when conducted through offshore jurisdictions, making the illicit origin of funds appear as genuine insurance activity.
- [Offshore Insurance Schemes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0085) — - Criminals open single-premium or investment-linked policies in offshore jurisdictions with lax regulatory frameworks, injecting illicit funds as premium payments.
- They then rapidly redeem or surrender these policies, making the resulting payouts appear to be legitimate insurance proceeds rather than criminal assets.
- In some instances, staged or fictitious claims (e.g., phantom vessels) provide an ostensibly lawful source of payouts, further obscuring illicit origins through multi-jurisdictional layering.
- Offshore secrecy impedes investigations by masking beneficial ownership and complicating funds tracing.
- [Early Surrender](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0086.001) — - Criminals purchase insurance policies with illicit funds, often structuring or overinflating premium payments from multiple jurisdictions or via third-party payers.
- They then prematurely surrender these policies, incurring surrender penalties but receiving payouts that appear to be standard insurance refunds.
- The surrender proceeds effectively disguise illicit funds as legitimate policy disbursements, achieving layering and integration.
- Ownership details can be further obscured by naming unrelated beneficiaries and routing premium payments through difficult-to-trace third parties.
- [Insurance Policy Overfunding](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0090.002) — - Criminals make large or repeated premium payments (overfunding) into single-premium or investment-linked insurance policies using illicit money. 
- They later request partial surrenders or refunds under the guise of legitimate policy disbursements, thus retrieving laundered funds in an apparently routine insurance transaction.
- The policies’ built-in flexibility (e.g., easy top-ups, permissible early withdrawals) and acceptance of penalties mask the illicit origin, facilitating layering and, ultimately, integration of illegally sourced capital into the legitimate financial system.
- [Beneficial Ownership Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0088) — - Criminals repeatedly change the named policyholder or beneficiaries, concealing the individual who truly benefits.
- Nominee owners or shell entities can be inserted and then substituted again, ensuring the ultimate beneficiary remains nebulous.
- Gaps in beneficiary tracking allow these manipulations to go unchecked, thwarting beneficial ownership transparency.
- [Financial Product Overfunding](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0086) — - Criminals deliberately overfund life insurance or similar policies with sums well above typical premium payments, often using third-party payers unrelated to the policyholder.

## [Bill of Exchange](https://framework.amltrix.com/instruments/IN0035)

**Description:**
A negotiable financial instrument obligating its drawee to pay a specified amount to a payee on a predetermined date or on demand. Frequently used in domestic and international trade finance to manage credit and secure payments.

### Related Techniques
- [Ghost Shipping](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0069.002) — - In documentary collection schemes, a bill of exchange is drawn for goods purportedly in transit, though they do not actually exist.
- Participating banks release funds upon receiving these documents, unaware that the shipment is fabricated.
- Without robust verification of the underlying cargo, the bill of exchange payment seamlessly integrates illicit proceeds into seemingly legitimate trade flows.
- [Trade-based Transaction Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0111) — - Overstated bills of exchange legitimize payments that exceed the actual value of goods, enabling criminals to embed illicit funds within trade transactions.
- The gap between the billed amount and the real shipment value represents concealed illicit proceeds.
- By falsifying or omitting supporting documents, launderers obscure the true nature of shipments, complicating due diligence efforts.
- [Bill of Exchange Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0074.001) — - Criminals fabricate or inflate bills of exchange, backed by falsified invoices and shipping documents, to deceive banks into granting credit or early payment under fictitious trade deals.
- Once the financing or discount is approved, they subsequently repay the bill of exchange with illicit proceeds disguised as legitimate trade settlements, effectively integrating tainted funds into the financial system.
- The paper-intensive, cross-border nature of bill of exchange transactions allows criminals to layer illicit funds through shell companies, complex webs of front entities, and repeated documentary transfers, making it difficult for investigators to trace the transactions’ true origin or purpose.
- [Invoice Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0008) — - Criminals attach overstated or fictitious invoice details to bills of exchange, obligating payment for goods or services that do not match the actual shipment.
- Acceptance of these inflated bills by financial intermediaries facilitates layering, as laundered funds appear to be part of legitimate trade settlements.
- [Multiple Invoicing](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0008.001) — Criminals issue multiple bills of exchange referencing the same shipment or service. Each bill obligates a payer to settle amounts that, in reality, have already been financed or paid elsewhere. This replication allows them to draw funding from several banks, obscuring the original transaction and accumulating multiple streams of illicit revenue.
- [Forging or Altering Financial Instruments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0126) — - Forgers modify payment amounts, beneficiary details, or due dates, circulating a falsified financial obligation. 
- Since bills of exchange are accepted as valid trade liabilities, these alterations legitimize otherwise illicit funds disguised as proceeds from normal business transactions.
- [Documentary Collection Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0077) — - Under documentary collection manipulations, criminals present a Bill of Exchange in conjunction with fraudulent or misleading shipping documents.
- The bank releases funds based on these documents without fully verifying the actual shipment or the authenticity of cargo details.
- This reliance on paperwork gives criminals a direct avenue to obscure the true nature of the transaction and integrate illicit proceeds into legitimate trade flows.

- [Multiple Currency Conversions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0115.001) — - Criminals place illicit proceeds into traditional bank or MSB channels and perform multiple FX conversions (e.g., USD to EUR, EUR to GBP) under the guise of legitimate business or hedging.
- They maintain accounts denominated in different currencies, orchestrating frequent cross-currency transfers that obscure the origin of funds.
- Splitting transactions below reporting thresholds across multiple providers or jurisdictions further conceals the layering scheme from regulators.
- [Regulated Exchange Mule Transactions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0011.001) — Illicit cash or fiat funds enter the exchange through wire transfers or physical deposits attributed to mule-controlled accounts. Once inside, these funds are commingled with legitimate transactions, effectively masking their illegal origin. Repeated deposits, trades, and withdrawals in fiat form make it more challenging for authorities to detect the layering activity.
- [Multi-Currency Swap](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0115.002) — - Multi-Currency Swap involves converting illicit funds among various fiat currencies (USD, EUR, JPY, etc.) to break the transaction trail.
- Criminals exploit differential regulations or weaker AML enforcement in certain locations to repeatedly exchange one fiat currency for another.
- Each conversion further obscures the origin of funds, complicating efforts by investigators to track transactions through multiple denominations and jurisdictions.
- [Complicit or Controlled FIs](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0082) — - Complicit MSBs specialize in currency exchange, enabling criminals to convert proceeds from one currency to another without triggering alerts.
- By neglecting suspicious activity reporting, the MSB blends illicit sums with normal exchange transactions, complicating tracing efforts by authorities.
- [Remittance Splitting](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0016.003) — Criminals exploit money remittance channels to split illicit fiat funds into multiple low-value transfers under false or multiple identities. These small amounts typically fall below formal reporting thresholds, enabling the layering of dirty money with minimal scrutiny. By directing numerous small transfers toward a single beneficiary, they obscure the true origin of the funds, masking illicit revenue flows within legitimate fiat currency transactions.
