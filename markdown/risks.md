### Related Techniques
- [Money Mule Exploitation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0011) —   Criminals recruit unwitting or complicit individuals (mules) who open or use personal and business accounts to move illicit proceeds. By leveraging these ostensibly legitimate customers, launderers obscure their own identities and complicate financial institutions' ability to detect suspicious activity. This is the primary vulnerability, as it exploits the bank's reliance on customer credentials and KYC processes that do not immediately reveal the true controlling parties.
- [Loan Schemes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0098) —   Criminals misrepresent borrower identities, ownership structures, and financial capacity through shell or front companies, falsified financial data, and forged documentation. These tactics exploit customer due diligence gaps, allowing nominally independent entities to apply for and receive loans without revealing the actual beneficial owners or the illicit source of funds.
- [Forced Labor](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0058.001) —   Shell or front companies pretend to conduct legitimate operations and misrepresent beneficial ownership to financial institutions, concealing the forced labor aspect. By posing as lawful employers, they channel withheld wages through the system under the guise of standard payroll or corporate income.
- [Remittance Splitting](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0016.003) —   Offenders use multiple or false sender identities to mask the true origin or ownership of funds, exploiting weaknesses in identification and KYC procedures for low-value remittances. This tactic leverages fraudulent or inconsistent personal data to further conceal illicit proceeds.
- [High-Cash Flow Real Estate](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0010.002) —   Criminals establish layered ownership structures or shell entities to obscure the beneficial owners of real estate assets. By concealing the individuals directing or profiting from the property, they exploit customer identity and ownership vulnerabilities, making it significantly more difficult for financial institutions and investigators to trace the ultimate source and control of illicit funds.
- [Corporate Structuring](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0130) —   This technique primarily exploits vulnerabilities in customer due diligence by creating complex or layered corporate ownership structures. Criminals obscure beneficial ownership and true control of assets, making it challenging for financial institutions to identify and verify ultimate owners. The continual manipulation of corporate hierarchies directly undermines KYC processes and beneficial ownership transparency, thus constituting the central operational vulnerability of this technique.
- [Safe Deposit Boxes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0043) —   Some clients, such as high-net-worth individuals from high-risk jurisdictions and politically exposed persons, might be more prone to misuse deposit boxes.
- [Intermediary-Facilitated Transfers](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0002) —   This technique focuses on concealing the true beneficial owner by using third-party intermediaries, who may be either complicit professionals or unsuspecting individuals. By inserting another party’s identity into official records, criminals exploit due diligence gaps related to beneficial ownership verification. This creates customer-related vulnerabilities and deprives institutions of critical risk indicators.
- [Professional Intermediaries](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0060) —   The core vulnerability arises from professionals acting on behalf of criminal clients, obscuring beneficial ownership. As these intermediaries become the institution’s 'customer of record,' KYC and due diligence checks are effectively thwarted, preventing clear identification of the true owners or controllers behind illicit funds.
- [Fraud](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144) —   Fraudsters frequently present false or manipulated customer details—such as forged identities, sham business registrations, or nominee arrangements—to financial institutions, lenders, or government programs. By obscuring beneficial ownership and misrepresenting their credentials, criminals bypass standard KYC checks and secure fraudulent loans or payouts, thereby compounding the primary product vulnerabilities.
- [Fictitious Creditors](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0103) —   Criminals exploit vulnerabilities in a business customer's accounting profile by inventing phony financial obligations and forging invoices or delivery notes. These fictitious liabilities mask suspicious outflows as legitimate payables, distorting the customer's transactional behavior and obscuring the origin of illicit funds. This is the primary risk because it relies on the false representation of the customer’s financial position to undermine AML monitoring efforts.
- [Commodity-based Trade Transactions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0125) —   Through the use of layered shell or front companies and concealed beneficial owners, individuals behind these commodity trades remain hidden. This technique relies on complex ownership structures that obscure the true controllers and facilitate under- or over-pricing. By distancing the real beneficiaries from the commodities and the financial transactions, adversaries make it harder for institutions to link suspicious flows to their actual source.
- [Front Company](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0014) —   Front companies operate as ostensibly legitimate customer entities, masking true beneficial ownership and co-mingling illicit proceeds with regular business income. This tactic exploits vulnerabilities in verifying beneficial owners and identifying the genuine source of funds, complicating KYC and ongoing due diligence.
- [Insider Trading](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0136) —   Criminals engaging in insider trading present themselves as standard investors or customers from the financial institution’s perspective. Their illicit proceeds blend seamlessly into normal trading profits, exploiting the institution’s customer due diligence processes and making it difficult to discern which trades rely on material non-public information. This is the pivotal vulnerability, as detecting suspicious behavior is hampered by the insider masquerading behind an otherwise legitimate customer profile.
- [Real Estate-based Methods](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0010) —   Criminals employ shell entities, straw buyers, and hidden beneficial ownership structures to obscure the true controllers of real estate assets. These opaque customer relationships undermine KYC efforts and enable criminals to distance themselves from illicit funds.
- [Funnel Accounts](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0083) —   The technique involves redirecting funds to multiple beneficiaries with no clear connection to the legitimate activities of the account holder, exploiting the lack of transparency in client relationships to obscure the origin of illicit funds.
- [Fake Vendors](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0022) —   This technique exploits vulnerabilities associated with fictitious or unverified vendor identities and beneficial ownership structures. Criminals create sham supplier accounts that distort the customer’s risk profile and hinder effective due diligence, as financial institutions cannot easily ascertain the legitimacy of these purported vendors or their controlling parties. This is the primary vulnerability enabling the laundering process through fraudulent invoices and payments masquerading as ordinary business expenditures.
- [Corruption](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0051) —   This technique primarily involves corrupt officials, such as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and public officials, abusing their positions of trust to generate illicit proceeds, categorizing them as high-risk customers. They exploit their status and power to conceal the origin of funds and evade scrutiny, complicating Anti-Money Laundering (AML) due diligence efforts.
- [Off-the-Record Deals](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0095) —   In addition to operating off the record, criminals deliberately obscure beneficial ownership by titling assets in the names of nominees or third parties while retaining de facto control. This hidden ownership structure directly exploits weaknesses in identifying and verifying the true parties involved.
- [Migrant Smuggling](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0059) —   Smugglers and their intermediaries often hide behind front companies or convoluted ownership structures, making it difficult to identify true controllers and legitimate business purposes.
- [Fictitious Payroll](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0068) —   Criminals create or manipulate corporate customers with opaque or inflated payroll structures, such as mini umbrella companies or ghost employees, to conceal true ownership and workforce details. This technique leverages suspicious wage disbursements and false reporting, making the business itself a high-risk customer from a financial institution’s perspective.
- [Financial Product Overfunding](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0086) —   Offenders obscure beneficial ownership by using third-party payers unrelated to the policyholder, frequently altering policy beneficiaries, or transferring ownership. These actions exploit weaknesses in KYC and due diligence processes, hindering the institution’s ability to identify the true controlling parties behind the funds.
- [Beneficial Ownership Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0088) —   Criminals exploit vulnerabilities in identifying true beneficial owners by frequently adding, removing, or substituting owners or beneficiaries. This repeated reshuffling of official records defeats standard CDD/KYC processes, making it exceedingly difficult for financial institutions to determine the ultimate controller of assets. The central operational vulnerability lies in complex or constantly changing ownership structures that obscure who truly owns or controls the funds.
- [Insurance Annuities](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0087) —   Criminals frequently employ nominees or unrelated third parties as policyholders or beneficiaries. These opaque or shifting ownership and beneficiary relationships obscure the true individuals behind the illicit funds, hindering standard KYC and beneficial ownership checks.
- [Free Trade Zones](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0041) —   Entities registering in the free zone may have opaque corporate structures.
- [Sanctions Evasion](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0141) —   Adversaries further obscure sanctioned entities' involvement by creating shell or front companies, manipulating beneficial ownership structures, and forging documentation. These tactics exploit weaknesses in customer due diligence processes that fail to detect the true owners and beneficiaries.
- [Player Image Rights Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0129.001) —   Criminals exploit the opacity of beneficial ownership in shell companies and complex third-party ownership arrangements tied to player image rights. By disguising illicit proceeds as inflated or fictitious licensing fees, they obscure the ultimate controllers of the funds and evade AML scrutiny. This reliance on convoluted ownership structures is the central vulnerability enabling the laundering scheme.
- [Gold Conversion](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0055.001) —   Unregistered or unregulated gold dealers, along with complex ownership structures behind entities trading in gold, may conceal illicit proceeds by blending them with legitimate precious metals transactions.
- [Informal Micro-Finance Schemes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0096) —   Participants in tontines may use concealed identities or nominees, which increases client risk by obscuring the true identity of individuals involved in the scheme and facilitates money laundering activities.
- [Shell Companies](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0001) —   Shell companies exploit opaque ownership structures, using nominee directors and fictitious shareholders to mask true beneficial owners. This hinders financial institutions' ability to conduct effective Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and identify the individuals controlling illicit funds, making it the primary vulnerability exposed by this technique.
- [Regulated Exchange Mule Transactions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0011.001) —   The technique relies on forging or falsifying KYC documentation and using multiple mule accounts to bypass identity and beneficial ownership checks at regulated exchanges. Criminals exploit these false identities and mule arrangements to layer illicit funds and conceal the true beneficiaries.
- [Unlicensed MSBs](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0013.001) —   The use of Shadow MSBs allows clients to bypass customer due diligence requirements, enabling individuals or entities with high-risk profiles to move funds without detection or scrutiny.
- [Manipulation of Financial Records](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0050) —   This technique relies on the customer (the business entity) providing falsified accounting records and financial statements to conceal illicit fund flows. By masking genuine transaction patterns behind fabricated invoices, accruals, or backdated entries, the criminals undermine financial institutions' normal monitoring procedures—which rely significantly on information supplied by the customer—and obscure the true nature of fund movements.
- [Oil and Fuel Transaction Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0111.001) —   Shell or anonymous companies are formed to obscure the real owners behind oil and fuel trades. By falsifying corporate structures and changing beneficial ownership, criminals legitimize fraudulent invoices and shipping records, concealing the true individuals directing or profiting from illicit transactions. This customer-oriented vulnerability complements the cross-border nature of the technique by adding opacity to ownership details.
- [Lottery Winnings](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107.001) —   Front companies, nominees, or third-party associates are used to claim prizes, obscuring beneficial ownership and complicating AML efforts to identify the true source of funds. By shifting redemption to different parties, criminals further leverage opaque or complex ownership structures to mask their involvement.
- [Undeclared Earnings](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0137) —   Criminals exploit unregistered or informal businesses—entities that lack transparent ownership or reliable documentation—to conceal undeclared earnings outside of formal oversight. By underreporting or omitting income and relying on complicit or negligent accountants, they mask both the sources and true volumes of funds, thereby reducing the likelihood of triggering AML controls linked to customer identity and transactional scrutiny.
- [Extortion](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0049) —   The primary vulnerability arises from criminals depositing extorted proceeds under false pretenses, misrepresenting the source of funds as legitimate income or personal transactions. Financial institutions may not detect that the true origin is coerced cash, as customers obscure or omit key details linking deposits to threats or intimidation.
- [Freeports and Private Storage](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0131) —   The technique also relies on criminals hiding behind shell or offshore entities as registered owners of valuables stored in freeports. These opaque ownership structures obscure beneficial owners, thwart KYC processes, and limit investigators' ability to trace the ultimate controllers of illicit assets.
- [Money Mule Recruitment](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0140) —   Criminals persuade individuals—often financially vulnerable or unsuspecting—to receive and transfer illicit funds, leveraging their personal or newly opened accounts. This exploits customer vulnerabilities such as lack of awareness, willingness to earn quick profits, and minimal scrutiny over personal account usage, enabling the concealment of illicit proceeds.
- [Commodity Trafficking](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0143) —   Through shell and front companies, traffickers conceal the true beneficial ownership of proceeds from illicit commodity trade. Complex ownership structures and frequent changes in corporate information undermine KYC protocols, obscuring the individuals and transactions behind criminal profits.
- [Environmental Crime](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0145) —   Criminals obscure beneficial ownership by creating shell or front companies that are purportedly operating in the same sector (e.g., fishing or logging). These opaque ownership structures enable the commingling of illicit proceeds with legitimate revenue, hindering effective AML measures.
- [Tax Evasion & Fraud](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0147) —   Tax evasion primarily involves the customer (individual or entity) misrepresenting or concealing income and beneficial ownership details to avoid tax obligations. By underreporting revenue or using complex ownership structures and undisclosed accounts, offenders exploit vulnerabilities in how customer information is verified and monitored.
- [Third-Party Payments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0073) —   Criminals rely on external third-party account holders or proxies (e.g., friends, family, shell associates) to disguise beneficial ownership and complicate due diligence. By routing transactions through unrelated individuals, the true owners of illicit funds remain hidden from financial institutions, undermining AML customer identification processes.
- [Proxy Servers](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0015.002) —   Clients that rely heavily on proxy services without legitimate reasons may indicate a higher risk.
- [Auction Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0108) —   Use of shell companies, nominees, and other straw buyers obscures true beneficial ownership in auctions, including real estate flipping. This makes it difficult for AML controls to identify the ultimate source of funds or final beneficiaries.
- [Government Relief Program Fraud](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144.004) —   Criminals exploit identity-based vulnerabilities by forging personal or corporate data, using stolen or synthetic identities, or shell entities to fraudulently secure government relief funds. This technique relies on misrepresenting the applicant's true identity or eligibility, which is the primary vulnerability being targeted.
- [Phishing Mule Recruitment](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0140.002) —   Criminals use phishing campaigns and social engineering to recruit unsuspecting individuals as money mules, who appear legitimate from the institution’s perspective. Victims provide or open personal checking accounts for 'payment processing,' thereby masking the illicit origin of the funds and complicating KYC/AML checks.
- [Economic Relief Fraud](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144.005) —   This technique primarily exploits falsified or misrepresented customer and business credentials to obtain economic relief funds. Criminals submit forged documentation, synthetic identities, or exaggerated payroll/financial data, undermining standard due diligence on the true nature of applicants and beneficiaries.
- [Wash Trading](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0094.002) —   Wash trading relies on inadequate customer identification and beneficial ownership transparency, enabling criminals to open multiple brokerage or exchange accounts under different credentials or pseudonymous wallets. By exploiting minimal KYC measures, criminals can mask the true ownership behind each account and orchestrate self-dealing trades without raising immediate suspicion. This is a secondary vulnerability complementing the product-driven nature of wash trades.
- [Diplomatic Channels](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0084) —   Diplomatic personnel (PEPs) and senior officials of state-owned entities leverage their privileged status to bypass standard AML checks, obscuring beneficial ownership and transaction origins.

- [Decentralized Mixers](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0003.002) —   Decentralized mixers obscure transaction origins and ownership, significantly heightening a customer's money laundering and terrorist financing risk profile by undermining the ability to conduct standard due diligence and AML checks.
- [Early Superannuation Withdrawals](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0109) —   Offenders use stolen or manipulated customer identities to access existing superannuation accounts and submit forged early-withdrawal claims. This secondary vulnerability arises from weak verification of the applicant’s identity and supporting documentation, enabling both genuine and impersonated account holders to facilitate fraudulent payouts.
- [Legitimate Business Acquisitions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0014.001) —   Criminals exploit concealed or complex beneficial ownership by acquiring or establishing ostensibly legitimate businesses, including farmland or agribusiness, with illicit proceeds. They manipulate purchase prices, financial records, and valuations to embed dirty funds among legitimate revenue streams while obscuring the true source of capital. This relies on misleading customer and ownership information to bypass effective AML scrutiny.
- [Asset Management Deposits](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0123) —   Perpetrators deploy shell entities, nominee owners, and other opaque ownership structures to conceal the true beneficiaries of large asset management deposits, undermining customer due diligence processes.
- [Tax Rebate Fraud](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0147.002) —   Criminals establish or repurpose shell entities and use nominee arrangements to file fraudulent tax rebate claims, concealing the real beneficiaries who profit from inflated or fictitious refunds. This obfuscation of ownership and beneficiary details is the central vulnerability exploited, making it difficult for financial institutions to verify the legitimacy of customers' accounts and detect the illicit nature of incoming funds.
- [Trust-Based Obfuscation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0088.002) —   Trust-based obfuscation exploits vulnerabilities in identifying true beneficial owners. Criminals frequently change trustees, signatories, and beneficiaries, hindering financial institutions' efforts to match the trust's formal records with the genuine individuals controlling the funds. This core weakness in accurately verifying and monitoring ultimate ownership is the primary operational risk.
- [Rental Income Schemes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0010.004) —   Shell or front companies and nominee ownership structures are used to conceal the true controllers of funds and property assets. Falsified or opaque beneficial ownership arrangements allow criminals to mask their involvement and bypass effective customer due diligence when introducing illicit funds as rental income.
- [Document Forgery](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0012) —   Document forgery enables criminals to fabricate or alter identity information, exploiting KYC processes that depend on the authenticity of customer-provided IDs and corporate filings. By submitting forged credentials, money launderers obscure true beneficial ownership and impersonate legitimate customers, undermining effective AML controls.
- [Fictitious Employer-Employee Fraud](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144.016) —   This technique exploits weaknesses in verifying the authenticity of claimants' identities and employment records. Criminals submit fictitious or stolen personal details, fabricate job histories, and even invent entire businesses. Because these records appear valid (e.g., official pay stubs, business registrations), government benefit agencies and financial institutions may treat the resulting deposits as legitimate, thereby escaping standard AML scrutiny.
- [Bid Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0080) —   Collusive clients in a bid-rigging arrangement predetermine the winning bidder and manipulate contract values, generating illicit proceeds and obscuring true ownership. This creates client-related risks centered on hidden intermediaries and corrupt influences.
- [Identity Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0023) —   Criminals manipulate or fabricate customer identities—using forged, stolen, or synthetic documents—to bypass KYC checks and obscure beneficial ownership. This directly exploits vulnerabilities in verifying true customer identity, undermining standard risk profiling and monitoring processes.
- [Fictitious Consulting Firm](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0014.003) —   Criminals establish fictitious advisory firms that lack genuine operations, making it very difficult for financial institutions to verify their true beneficial owners or the legitimacy of their consulting activities. By misrepresenting the nature of the customer entity, they circumvent standard KYC measures and obscure illicit fund flows.
- [Sports Club Investments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0025) —   Criminals exploit opaque beneficial ownership structures behind large sports investments to mask illicit sources of funds, circumventing thorough vetting processes. The sports clubs’ limited KYC and beneficial ownership checks constitute the primary vulnerability, as concealing the true controllers of illicit capital enables the laundering scheme to operate under a veneer of legitimacy.
- [Exploitation of Professional Privileges](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0033) —   This technique primarily exploits vulnerabilities in beneficial ownership disclosure under professional privilege. Criminals hide ultimate beneficial owners behind attorneys or accountants who invoke confidentiality obligations, undermining the financial institution’s ability to accurately identify or trace customer identities.
- [Fake Job Recruitment](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0140.004) —   Criminals exploit unwitting individuals, known as money mules, by recruiting them under false pretenses and leveraging their personal bank accounts and established customer relationships to funnel illicit funds. Since these recruits appear to be ordinary customers with legitimate employment, financial institutions apply lower scrutiny, allowing criminals to obscure the true origin of the funds. The central vulnerability is the misuse of customer accounts and identities, making this the primary risk for this technique.
- [Offshore Transfers](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0062.003) —   In addition to exploiting offshore jurisdictions, criminals employ shell companies, trusts, and nominee arrangements to conceal the true beneficial owners behind these transfers. This opacity hinders financial institutions' ability to perform adequate due diligence and accurately identify or verify the ultimate parties controlling the funds.
- [Payroll Deduction Loan Repayment](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0029) —   Fictitious 'loan-back' arrangements and the use of nominees conceal the true borrower-lender relationship, obfuscating beneficial ownership and complicating CDD efforts. Criminals pose as or employ nominees who appear legitimate, while the funds ultimately trace back to the perpetrator’s own illicit sources.
- [Cash Wage Payments to Undocumented Workers](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0052.001) —   By hiring individuals lacking formal employment documentation, the business exploits the inability to verify workforce identities and payroll records. This lack of verifiable documentation allows illicit funds to be mingled with purported wages, concealing their true source. The core vulnerability lies in the obscured employee identity status, which undermines standard AML/KYC processes and creates a primary risk of disguising criminal proceeds within untracked payroll costs.

- [Human Trafficking](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0058) —   Traffickers use front or shell companies (e.g., massage parlors, recruitment agencies) to conceal the true ownership and nature of activities tied to forced labor or sexual exploitation. By falsifying payroll records and underreporting wages, they blend illicit proceeds with legitimate revenue, exploiting vulnerabilities in customer due diligence that fail to identify the real controllers and beneficiaries of these businesses.
- [Crowdfunding Campaign Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0044) —   Fake campaigns or beneficiaries can be created under false identities, allowing criminals to mask their involvement and complicate the identification of the ultimate fund controllers.
- [Social Media Mule Recruitment](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0140.001) —   Criminals leverage social media to target and recruit individuals—often financially vulnerable or unaware—who then use their personal bank accounts to receive and forward illicit funds. By presenting quick-income opportunities or supposed remote jobs, these launderers exploit the legitimate customer profiles of recruits, circumventing standard AML/KYC red flags and allowing repeated layering across multiple unwitting or complicit account holders.
- [Multiple Citizenship Identities](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0024) —   Criminals exploit multiple passports or nationalities to obscure or fragment their identities, directly undermining KYC and beneficial ownership checks. This is the primary vulnerability, as the technique fundamentally relies on exploiting confusion stemming from customers' complex or deceptive identity claims.
- [Business Investment](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0036) —   Criminals pose as legitimate investors or business owners, injecting illicit funds as equity or capital. By blending illegal proceeds with normal operating revenues, they exploit vulnerabilities in beneficial ownership due diligence. Financial institutions struggle to identify the true controllers behind these investments, making this the primary vulnerability.
- [Trade Finance Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0074) —   The involvement of shell or front companies as clients, which lack genuine commercial activity, poses a significant risk as they can be used to present fraudulent trade transactions and mislead financial institutions about the legitimacy of the trade.
- [Construction Project Schemes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0010.001) —   Shell firms, undisclosed beneficial owners, and PEP involvement create vulnerabilities in verifying who ultimately controls or benefits from construction projects. Criminals split or obscure ownership stakes, channel illicit funds through corporate layers, and bypass KYC obligations, especially when politically influential individuals or complex ownership webs are involved.
- [Pre-Shipment Finance Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0072) —   The use of shell or front companies with fictitious export contracts exposes the financial institution to client risk, as these entities lack genuine business operations and are used to obscure illicit activities.
- [Undisclosed Payment Aggregation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0138) —   By opening or misusing merchant accounts—sometimes without the legitimate merchant’s knowledge—criminals exploit weaknesses in verifying the true customer or beneficial owner. This misrepresentation conceals the actual parties behind illicit funds, undermining AML checks intended to link transactions to genuine identities.
- [Infiltration and Control of Banking Institutions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0099) —   By placing key personnel within the bank, criminals can exploit client relationships and profiles, leveraging the bank's existing customer base to facilitate laundering operations.
- [Payroll Tax Evasion](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0147.001) —   Firms or entities underreport payroll obligations and use shell structures or falsified corporate records to exploit vulnerabilities related to customer identity and ownership. By misrepresenting the true wage base to tax authorities and financial institutions, they obscure illicit proceeds and pose a significant customer risk. This is the primary vulnerability exploited by the payroll tax evasion technique.
- [Chargeback](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0091) —   Criminals exploit falsified, stolen, or synthetic customer identities to initiate disputes that appear legitimate, masking laundering activity. This misuse of the "customer" role—often in collusion with merchants—creates false narratives and disrupts trust-based dispute mechanisms, making identity integrity and customer behavior an important risk vector.
- [Multi-Jurisdiction Corporate Structures](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0001.003) —   By layering complex corporate vehicles and employing nominee directors or shareholders, criminals conceal true beneficial ownership and undermine KYC processes. This creates significant opacity around customer identity and ownership structures, frustrating due diligence efforts.
- [Proxy Arrangement](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0038) —   This technique primarily exploits weaknesses in identifying and verifying the true beneficial owner. By installing a proxy or nominee as the official account holder or controller, criminals obscure the real individual behind the funds, frustrating customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring processes.
- [Casino Mule Networks](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0011.003) —   By recruiting multiple mules, each conducting structured transactions under different names and thresholds, criminals exploit gaps in customer monitoring and KYC protocols. The broad distribution of chip purchases, redemptions, and account deposits across various mules adds a layer of anonymity and obscures the ultimate source of funds.
- [Cooperative or Mutual Institution Deposits](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0120) —   These membership-based entities require minimal documentation for account opening or share purchases, enabling criminals—acting as 'members'—to disguise illicit funds as ordinary contributions. The philanthropic or community mission further reduces KYC rigor, allowing suspicious customer behavior to go undetected.
- [Charitable and Non-Profit Organizations](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0019) —   Criminals establish or infiltrate non-profit entities, leveraging their charity status and relaxed AML scrutiny to hide behind philanthropic gestures. By embedding complicit individuals in staff or management, they bypass typical KYC controls, obscure beneficial ownership, and make it more difficult for financial institutions to detect illicit activity.
- [Cash Wage Payments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0052) —   Criminals exploit the minimal record-keeping and off-the-books wage practices of cash-intensive businesses to embed illicit funds within ordinary payroll expenses, bypassing standard documentation and oversight.
- [Virtual Companies](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0127) —   Criminals exploit opaque or fabricated beneficial ownership details by establishing intangible, online-only entities that frustrate KYC checks. Nominee directors and virtual business addresses conceal the true controllers of these companies, making this the primary vulnerability for financial institutions trying to verify who ultimately owns or controls the funds.
- [Misappropriation of Public Funds](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0051.001) —   In this technique, the central vulnerability arises from the fact that the misappropriators of public funds are themselves politically exposed persons (PEPs) or other public officials. They exploit their trusted positions and direct access to government budgets or accounts. Financial institutions face heightened risk due to the potential for large-scale transactions and hidden beneficial ownership structures tied to these high-profile customers.
- [Commodity Smuggling](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0048) —   Front or shell companies with opaque ownership structures participate in these trade transactions, obscuring the ultimate beneficial owners and the true nature of the shipments. This limits effective Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) measures, as financial institutions cannot easily verify the legitimacy of the parties behind the smuggled commodities.
- [Misrepresentation of Fund Purpose](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0040) —   Central to this technique is the financial institution’s reliance on the customer’s declared transaction purpose. Offenders supply falsified or misleading explanations (e.g., claiming charitable donations, import expenses, family gifts) to obscure the illicit origin or intent of funds. By exploiting this reliance on customer-submitted information, criminals circumvent AML scrutiny and blend illicit proceeds with legitimate financial activity.
- [Invoice Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0008) —   Shell or front companies with opaque beneficial owners facilitate the manipulation of invoices, concealing the true parties behind these transactions and complicating due diligence. By obscuring ownership structures, criminals add a secondary layer of vulnerability that frustrates customer identification and verification processes.
- [Art Market Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0045.003) —   Shell companies and offshore structures obscure beneficial ownership, allowing criminals to mask their identities and exploit gaps in customer due diligence. This takes advantage of vulnerabilities in identifying the true parties behind high-value art trades.
- [Protection Payments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0049.002) —   Organized crime groups and extremist organizations forcibly collect extortion proceeds, known as protection payments, and then falsely present themselves as legitimate business customers through shell or front companies to financial institutions. By obscuring beneficial ownership and misrepresenting the nature of incoming funds, they exploit KYC/AML processes and conceal the illicit origins of these recurring payments.
- [Captive Insurance](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0090.001) —   The technique often involves clients establishing self-owned insurance entities, which can be used to manipulate financial flows through complex structures. This makes it difficult to ascertain the true beneficial ownership and detect illicit activities.
- [Smurfing](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0016.005) —   Smurfing also involves using multiple depositors or 'money mules,' which obscures beneficial ownership and complicates customer due diligence. Each smurf's transactions appear individually innocuous, adding a distinct layer of anonymity and hindering effective KYC processes.
- [Pension Fund Contributions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0037) —   Fraudulent or opaque beneficiary designations and contributor profiles enable criminals to mask true ownership. Large deposits exceeding legitimate income and undisclosed beneficiary relationships exploit gaps in KYC and due diligence processes.
- [Fictitious Jewelry Business](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0014.005) —   The fictitious jewelry enterprise often relies on opaque or shifting ownership structures to hide the true controllers. This secondary vulnerability complicates KYC and UBO checks, as frequent ownership changes or nominal directors mask the real beneficiaries behind the purported business activities.
- [CBI or RBI-Based Identity Acquisition](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0024.001) —   Criminals exploit newly acquired passports or residencies to present themselves as legitimate customers with apparently clean backgrounds, circumventing enhanced due diligence checks tied to their real identities. By using CBI/RBI documentation, they obscure past offenses, the illicit origins of funds, or PEP status, thereby reducing scrutiny and increasing the likelihood that financial institutions will onboard them as low-risk customers.
- [Entertainment Venture Fronts](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0014.006) —   This technique primarily exploits vulnerabilities arising from opaque or complex ownership structures in entertainment ventures. Criminals conceal the true beneficial owners behind layered entities, inject illicit funds as sponsorship or production capital, and claim them as legitimate revenues, thereby frustrating effective KYC and due diligence efforts by financial institutions.
- [Asset Cloaking](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0009) —   Asset Cloaking fundamentally exploits opaque beneficial ownership structures. Criminals establish multiple tiers of shell or shelf companies and use nominees or trustees, preventing financial institutions from accurately identifying ultimate beneficial owners. This layering of ownership is the primary vulnerability targeted by the technique, as it directly obscures who controls illicit funds.
- [Mobile Payment Systems](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0134.002) —   Use of stolen or fabricated identities directly undermines KYC procedures. Criminals open numerous mobile payment accounts under false credentials, concealing beneficial ownership and creating challenges for investigators trying to link transactions back to illicit sources.
- [Political Contributions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0056) —   Criminals exploit customer-related vulnerabilities by concealing the true identities or beneficial ownership of donors who pose as legitimate political supporters. This technique leverages shell entities, nonprofits, or consulting contracts to obscure the individuals ultimately controlling the funds, undermining AML efforts by masking illicit sources behind purported campaign or lobbying donors.
- [Bond Investments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0061.004) —   Criminals obscure beneficial ownership by placing bonds under the names of relatives or third parties, complicating customer due diligence and hindering the identification of the actual source of funds.
- [Complicit or Controlled FIs](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0082) —   Criminals conceal or falsify the beneficial ownership of the MSB using nominee structures or shell companies, obscuring their true identities. This hidden ownership presents an elevated risk profile to counterparties, as it thwarts customer due diligence and masks who ultimately controls the funds.
- [Court System Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0047) —   Bad actors may fabricate or manipulate lawsuits under false pretenses, potentially obscuring the actual ownership of funds and misleading the institution about the true parties involved.
- [Service Contract Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0098) —   As a secondary risk, convoluted ownership structures and shell entities make it difficult to ascertain the ultimate beneficiaries behind these service contracts. This complexity hinders KYC checks and obscures the individuals controlling the illicit funds.
- [Educational Institution Schemes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0019.001) —   Criminals exploit the privileged legal status and social trust of nonprofit educational institutions to obscure beneficial ownership. These entities typically receive fewer AML checks and enjoy reputational credibility, allowing illicit actors to register or acquire such institutions to mask criminal proceeds as legitimate tuition, donations, or grants. This reduces scrutiny and complicates the identification of beneficial ownership.
- [Deceptive Tax Filings](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0014.007) —   This technique primarily exploits the reliance on self-reported financial information and beneficial ownership details. Criminals falsify tax returns by underreporting income, concealing assets, or misrepresenting beneficial ownership to legitimize illicit funds without triggering AML red flags.
- [Real Estate Escrow Flip](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0010.006) —   Use of shell entities or intermediaries to purchase and resell high-value goods conceals beneficial ownership and complicates source-of-funds verification, presenting heightened exposure for the institution.
- [Ponzi Schemes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144.019) —   Operators of Ponzi schemes often use shell or front companies with obscure beneficial ownership to layer and disguise incoming investor capital. These opaque structures exploit vulnerabilities in customer due diligence processes, further obscuring the origin and ownership of tainted funds.
- [Underground Gambling](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107.007) —   The involvement of clients using unlicensed betting offices, who may be linked to organized crime or possess complex ownership structures, increases the risk of obscuring illicit financial flows.

### Related Techniques
- [Automated Transaction Systems](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0026) —   Relies on products that enable speed or anonymity—fast-payment rails, API-driven PSPs, neobanks, crypto exchanges, reloadable prepaid cards. Their high limits, 24/7 availability and sometimes weak KYC give scripts the freedom to move and split value rapidly, bypassing conventional velocity/amount rules.
- [Pig Butchering](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144.009) —   Criminals exploit the inherent features of cryptocurrency products, such as rapid transfers, anonymous or pseudo-anonymous wallet addresses, and minimal KYC requirements at certain crypto ATMs, to layer and obscure stolen funds. This product-focused vulnerability is distinct from the channel dimension, as it directly facilitates the laundering of illicit proceeds following the initial online scam.
- [Cross-Border Settlement Document Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0012.001) —   This technique relies on falsifying trade finance and settlement documents, such as invoices, bills of lading, and letters of credit, exploiting the inherent vulnerability of documentary-based products. Financial institutions and settlement networks depend on the accuracy of these records for cross-border transactions, making them susceptible when criminals alter or forge paperwork to legitimize illicit funds.
- [Currency Exchange Conversions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0115) —   Currency exchange services are the core product vulnerability exploited here. Criminals repeatedly swap currencies to layer illicit proceeds, taking advantage of minimal KYC at some exchange offices and the speed and opacity of multi-currency transactions. This enables rapid layering and obscures the funds’ origin, making product risk the primary threat vector.
- [Loan Schemes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0098) —   This technique exploits vulnerabilities inherent in loans as a financial product. Criminals falsify or omit required documentation, manipulate collateral requirements, and abuse government-subsidized loan programs to introduce illicit proceeds as seemingly legitimate loan disbursements or repayments. By structuring these funds through routine lending processes, criminals mask their true origin and circumvent standard due diligence controls.
- [Structuring](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0016) —   Structuring exploits threshold-based controls inherent in deposit, remittance, and related financial products. By methodically splitting larger sums into sub-threshold transactions, criminals leverage product-level alerts—such as currency transaction reporting triggers—to evade detection and circumvent automatic monitoring tools. This technique depends on the built-in threshold mechanisms of each product or service, ensuring every deposit or transfer remains nominally compliant and undetectable when viewed individually.
- [Forced Labor](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0058.001) —   Criminals exploit payroll services and business banking products to commingle forced labor proceeds with legitimate wage payments, masking the illicit origin. By labeling withheld or underpaid wages as normal payroll or operating income, they exploit the inherent reliance on self-reported wage data and business activity within these products.
- [High-Cash Flow Real Estate](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0010.002) —   This technique primarily exploits real estate businesses with high cash flow and frequent transactions. Criminals commingle illicit funds among routine rental or service payments, leveraging the product's inherent large volume of transactions to mask suspicious activity. By blending illegal proceeds with legitimate real estate income, they reduce the likelihood of detection and facilitate integration into the financial system.
- [Safe Deposit Boxes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0043) —   Safe deposit box services inherently enable criminals to store physical assets (cash, precious metals, valuables) outside standard transaction records. Minimal or lax identity verification for box rentals and the ability to pay fees in cash allow users to maintain anonymity, stagger deposits and withdrawals undetected, and circumvent typical AML thresholds. These product-specific features form the core vulnerability exploited by this technique, making it the primary risk.
- [Cryptocurrency Mixing](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0003) —   Criminals exploit the inherent anonymity features of mixing services by pooling user deposits and obfuscating on-chain transaction links. By blending tainted funds with legitimate flows, mixers circumvent standard AML controls, making it extremely difficult to trace or differentiate illicit proceeds from innocent user activity. This technique directly leverages the product’s core functionality—anonymity and commingling—to defeat routine compliance checks, thereby posing a primary vulnerability.
- [Counterfeit Currency](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0092) —   Criminals exploit the inherent vulnerabilities of physical currency acceptance. By forging banknotes and relying on limited verification or detection measures, they introduce counterfeit funds into circulation and then deposit them into financial channels. This is the core operational weakness that underpins the technique.
- [Fraud](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144) —   This technique exploits the inherent features of various financial products and services—such as invoice financing, trade finance, loan programs, and donation platforms—by submitting fraudulent invoices, forged documents, or fabricated eligibility data. Criminals generate new illicit proceeds under the guise of legitimate product usage, relying on weak or easily circumvented product controls to secure financing, government disbursements, or donations. This vulnerability is central to how fraud creates newly launderable funds from the start.
- [Sports Sponsorship](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0129) —   Criminals exploit the inherent features of sports betting, sponsorship deals, and image-rights arrangements to hide illicit proceeds behind seemingly legitimate sports revenues. By structuring large bets, sponsorship agreements, or image-rights payments, they introduce layers of transactions that obscure the true origin of funds within these specialized products and services.
- [Darknet Marketplace Transactions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0100) —   Additionally, this technique relies on the anonymity features of cryptocurrencies—such as privacy coins, mixed or tumbled transactions, and cross-chain transfers—to complicate traceability and obscure the illicit origin of funds. These product-specific features limit AML monitoring and create barriers for investigative efforts.
- [Fictitious Creditors](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0103) —   The technique exploits vulnerabilities in financing products such as invoice or supply chain financing. Criminals submit forged invoices or claim nonexistent payables to secure funds, embedding illicit proceeds under the guise of legitimate business credit. By misusing these financial instruments, they further layer and conceal illicit flows.
- [Privacy Coins](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0116) —   Criminals leverage inherent anonymity features (e.g., ring signatures, stealth addresses, zero-knowledge proofs) in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, which fundamentally obscure transaction details and ownership. This built-in anonymity is the primary vulnerability, enabling layering that undermines traceability and hampers AML monitoring.
- [Carbon Credit Trading](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0118) —   The intangible nature of carbon credits enables criminals to rapidly buy and sell these specialized instruments, obscuring transaction trails and exploiting inconsistent AML controls. This inherent property facilitates advanced layering, including carousel fraud schemes, as carbon credits can be traded multiple times with minimal disclosure requirements.
- [Domestic Bulk Cash Delivery](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0119) —   Subsequent structured deposits exploit the inherent vulnerabilities of cash transaction products, such as bank accounts, by splitting illicit funds below reporting limits. This layering tactic leverages thresholds designed for typical usage, enabling criminals to integrate large sums of illicit currency without triggering standard product-level alerts.
- [Commodity-based Trade Transactions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0125) —   This technique primarily exploits the vulnerabilities inherent in trade finance and commodity-based transactions. Criminals falsify or manipulate invoices, shipping documents, and letters of credit tied to high-value or high-volume commodities, making it difficult for financial institutions to detect suspicious pricing or verify the authenticity of trades. By repeatedly under- or over-invoicing and routing goods through complex trade finance products, illicit proceeds are layered and obscured under the guise of legitimate commodity transactions.
- [Real Estate-based Methods](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0010) —   This technique primarily exploits real estate transactions (the product) by manipulating valuations, leveraging property flips, and disguising proceeds through fictitious rental income. The flexible pricing and variable oversight in real estate create a central vulnerability that criminals use to conceal and transform illicit funds.
- [Funnel Accounts](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0083) —   Funnel accounts exploit the vulnerabilities of common deposit and transfer products, such as personal checking or business bank accounts. Criminals structure small cash deposits below reporting thresholds and quickly transfer or withdraw those funds, taking advantage of the product’s ability to accommodate rapid movement of funds with minimal scrutiny. This is the central vulnerability that enables layering and obfuscation.
- [Online Gambling](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0017) —   Online gambling's inherent feature of easily converting deposited funds into 'winnings' creates a distinct vulnerability. Criminals exploit the ability to commingle illicit proceeds with legitimate wagers and rapidly withdraw them as apparently authentic gambling profits, obscuring the funds' illegal origin.
- [Bearer Instruments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0042) —   Criminals exploit the inherent design of bearer instruments, which confer ownership based solely on physical possession. This bypasses standard beneficial ownership registries, enabling illicit actors to obscure their identities and the origins of funds. Financial institutions face significant challenges in verifying the source of funds and beneficiary details precisely because the product's nature thwarts typical transparency measures.
- [High-Value Collectibles Conversion](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0007) —   Criminals exploit inherent vulnerabilities in high-value goods (e.g., gold, diamonds, artwork) such as opaque or subjective pricing and minimal regulatory oversight. By repeatedly purchasing and reselling these commodities—often through private transactions or across borders—they reduce transparency for financial institutions. These features enable layering and integration of illicit funds under the guise of legitimate commercial activity, masking true origins and beneficial ownership.
- [Precious Metals & Stones Trading](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0055) —   Criminals exploit the inherently high-value and subjective nature of precious metals and gemstones to obscure illicit funds. Minimal identification requirements, ease of transport, and difficulty in establishing true market values allow criminals to under- or overvalue these commodities, blend illicit items with legitimate ones, and ultimately convert illegal proceeds into ostensibly lawful revenue through resale. This is the central vulnerability exploited by the technique.
- [Fictitious Payroll](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0068) —   Payroll processing and wage distribution systems are exploited because routine salary disbursements are rarely scrutinized at each payee level. Criminals insert ghost employees, inflate legitimate wages, or forge contractor payments to channel illicit funds as ostensibly legitimate payroll expenses, thereby exploiting the inherent vulnerabilities of payroll services themselves.
- [NFT-based Value Obfuscation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0064) —   Criminals exploit NFT marketplaces' inherent vulnerabilities—such as minimal KYC requirements and arbitrary valuations—to conduct wash trading, artificially inflate NFT prices, and obscure the sources of illicit funds under the pretense of legitimate art sales. This aligns directly with the product-level features of NFTs that enable layering and integration.
- [Financial Product Overfunding](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0086) —   Exploits flexible premium/contribution and refund features in financial products, reintroducing illicit funds disguised as normal payouts.
- [Insurance Annuities](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0087) —   Criminals exploit the inherent flexibility of annuity products—such as lump-sum or structured premium payments, partial withdrawals, policy loans, and early surrenders—to disguise illicit funds as legitimate investment proceeds. The repetitive nature of policy transfers or surrenders further leverages the features of annuity products, making it more difficult to trace the original source.
- [Countertrade](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0079) —   Criminals exploit the inherent vulnerabilities of trade-based arrangements by using reciprocal, non-cash exchanges and manipulated invoices or valuations. Through repeated or mislabeled commodity shipments and falsified trade documents, they leverage the limited transparency of these specialized transactions to embed and move illicit funds. This is the primary vulnerability exploited by countertrade schemes.
- [Gold Conversion](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0055.001) —   Criminals exploit gold's inherent vulnerabilities as a commodity—including subjective valuations, ease of resale, and a wide range of physical and intangible (paper/digital) forms—to mask the true origin of illicit funds. They can reclassify high-purity bullion as scrap to bypass export controls and exploit the opacity in gold transactions at placement, layering, and integration stages. This constitutes the central operational vulnerability being leveraged in this technique.
- [Investment in Financial Instruments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0061) —   Criminals exploit the intrinsic complexity and lighter AML oversight of private investment vehicles, such as hedge funds or private equity, to conceal illicit proceeds and beneficial ownership. These sophisticated products often allow large inflows with minimal scrutiny, enabling the layering and blending of unlawful funds within seemingly legitimate investment portfolios.
- [Jewelry Valuation Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0045.001) —   Criminals exploit the inherent subjectivity and high portability of jewelry by repeatedly inflating or underreporting its value. Since valuations can vary widely and are often not rigorously verified, adversaries can layer funds through multiple resales. This is the central vulnerability that enables distorted price declarations to disguise illicit proceeds.
- [Counterfeit Goods](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0143.001) —   Trade finance instruments, including letters of credit, are misused to move revenue from counterfeit goods under the guise of legitimate transactions. By falsifying invoices, shipping records, or other supporting documentation, criminals secure financing or bank guarantees that mask the illicit origin of proceeds from fake merchandise.
- [Asset Valuation Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0045) —   Criminals exploit the inherent subjectivity or complexity in appraising high-value items, such as art, real estate, digital assets, and luxury goods, to deliberately overvalue or undervalue them. This manipulation allows them to launder illicit funds by justifying large monetary inflows or outflows as legitimate changes in asset valuations, thereby obscuring the true origin of the proceeds.
- [Privacy Wallets](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0034.001) —   This technique primarily exploits anonymity-enabled wallet products to hinder detection. Criminals leverage advanced privacy features such as coinjoin, stealth addresses, and zero-knowledge proofs inherent to these wallets. These features obscure beneficial ownership and transaction histories, making it significantly harder for regulated entities to trace or monitor funds.
- [Oil and Fuel Transaction Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0111.001) —   Complex global trade channels and multi-layered financial arrangements (e.g., letters of credit, trade financing, shipping lines) can obscure money flows.
- [Lottery Winnings](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107.001) —   Criminals exploit lottery and gambling products by purchasing large volumes of tickets or acquiring winning tickets from legitimate recipients, then redeeming the proceeds under their own name. This transforms illicit funds into apparently legitimate winnings by leveraging the inherent anonymity, high payout potential, and direct redemption structure of these products.
- [Extortion](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0049) —   As a secondary risk, extortion proceeds are often channeled into front businesses such as those in the hospitality, retail, or merchant sectors, which naturally handle significant cash or transaction volumes. By commingling forced payments with routine daily revenues, criminals exploit the inherent vulnerabilities of cash-intensive products and services, making extorted funds indistinguishable from legitimate income.
- [Cryptocurrency Investment](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0128) —   This technique primarily exploits the pseudonymous and easily transferable nature of cryptocurrencies. Criminals repeatedly trade, swap, or reinvest digital assets (including privacy-focused coins or mixing protocols) to create complex layering chains that obscure beneficial ownership and impede detection. These inherent product features—such as ease of cross-wallet movement and partial anonymity—are central to the laundering process.
- [Stock Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0094.001) —   Criminals exploit the inherent complexities of equity and derivatives trading—such as high volumes, volatility, and opaque price movements—to obscure the illicit origin of funds. By orchestrating pump-and-dump schemes, wash trading, and other manipulative techniques, they leverage these financial products' complexity to blend illicit proceeds into seemingly legitimate market transactions.
- [Documentary Collection Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0077) —   Criminals exploit documentary collection (D/P or D/A) arrangements—an inherently paper-based trade finance product—by forging or misrepresenting transport documents. Banks typically rely on these documents alone to release funds, with minimal independent verification of actual shipments. Criminals take advantage of this product-specific vulnerability to conceal the true nature or value of illicit transactions.
- [Offshore Prepaid and E-Wallet Issuance](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0062.001) —   This technique primarily exploits the inherent vulnerabilities of stored-value instruments, such as prepaid cards and e-wallets, by leveraging low or minimal KYC requirements, partial anonymity, and easy cross-border usage. These features enable repeated reloading and near-anonymous transactions to layer illicit funds. The product features are the central operational weakness facilitating the laundering scheme.
- [Auction Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0108) —   Criminals exploit the inherent vulnerabilities in auction services—particularly minimal AML checks, private or sealed bidding, and lax due diligence—to layer and conceal illicit funds. This technique relies on the auction product’s structural weaknesses (e.g., limited transparency, inadequate KYC) to obscure transactional details and thwart detection.
- [Rug Pull](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144.003) —   Rug pull schemes fundamentally exploit newly launched crypto or NFT offerings with minimal oversight or investor protections. Fraudsters leverage the ease of creating and marketing new tokens, quickly soliciting funds before removing all liquidity. This product-based vulnerability, characterized by a lack of regulatory scrutiny and unchecked token mechanics, is central to their success.
- [Alternative Payment Channels](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0134) —   Criminals exploit inherent vulnerabilities in certain alternative payment products (e.g., reloadable prepaid cards with little or no customer verification, pseudo-anonymous cryptocurrencies). These product features—such as easy reloading and minimal KYC—facilitate undetected layering and placement.
- [Wash Trading](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0094.002) —   This technique exploits the inherent vulnerabilities of trading products (e.g., securities, cryptocurrencies, NFTs) that allow self-dealing trades to go unnoticed in real time. By repeatedly buying and selling the same asset among collusive accounts, wash trading leverages minimal scrutiny of artificially generated volume and price signals, obscuring the true source of funds. This is the primary vulnerability enabling manipulation of trading platforms and disguising illicit proceeds as legitimate gains.
- [Illicit Antiquities Trade](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0007.001) —   Criminals exploit the inherent vulnerabilities of the antiquities market, including subjective valuations and weak provenance checks. By forging authenticity documents, arbitrarily adjusting prices, and repeatedly transferring ownership records, they leverage these product-specific features to layer illicit proceeds. This risk is primary because it directly stems from the nature of high-value cultural artifacts as a product, where valuation and legitimacy are easily manipulated.
- [Wire Transfer Chains](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0070.001) —   Criminals exploit the inherent vulnerabilities of wire transfer services—specifically their speed, cross-institution reach, and partial transaction visibility—to layer illicit proceeds. By splitting funds into multiple wire transfers across different banks, often below reporting thresholds, they take advantage of the product’s transactional nature to evade detection when each transfer is viewed in isolation. This constitutes the primary vulnerability in this technique.
- [Offshore Insurance Schemes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0085) —   Insurance-based financial products, particularly single-premium and investment-linked policies, enable criminals to place large sums of illicit funds, swiftly redeem them, and stage or fabricate claims. This inherent vulnerability in these insurance products facilitates layering and disguises the criminal origin of the funds.
- [Virtual Token](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0067) —   Criminals exploit the inherent qualities of virtual tokens (stablecoins, DeFi tokens, governance tokens, etc.) to rapidly convert proceeds into multiple token formats, fragment transaction histories, and hamper detection. The ability to create and trade tokens with minimal regulation is the central operational vulnerability, making this the primary risk for this technique.
- [Cryptocurrency Mining](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0020) —   Primary vulnerability lies in the inherent features of cryptocurrency mining itself. Newly minted coins emerge without prior transaction histories, allowing illicit proceeds spent on mining costs to reappear as 'clean' assets. This core product-level property inherently obscures the original source of funds.
- [Unemployment Insurance Fraud](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144.008) —   Criminals exploit government-issued prepaid cards and easily accessible personal checking accounts to receive and layer fraudulent unemployment disbursements. The minimal verification requirements of prepaid or stored-value products allow quick, anonymous access to proceeds, making it difficult for financial institutions to detect the illegitimate source of funds.
- [Loyalty Points](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0106) —   Criminals exploit loyalty and reward point programs, which function as unregulated stored-value instruments, with minimal AML oversight, often lacking loading limits, and the ability to redeem points as near-cash substitutes. By pooling, transferring, and rapidly converting points across multiple accounts or platforms, they obscure the flow and origin of illicit funds, taking advantage of the fundamental product features of loyalty schemes.
- [Shelf Companies](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0001.001) —   In addition to concealing ownership, shelf companies often include pre-existing bank accounts or credit lines. This feature bypasses typical scrutiny on newly opened accounts, allowing immediate layering and swift placement of illicit proceeds under the guise of established business activities.
- [Payment Tokens](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0067.001) —   The core vulnerability lies in the inherent features of payment tokens—pseudonymity, high liquidity, and rapid cross-border settlement—that allow criminals to conduct micro-structured transactions (smurfing) and obscure transaction trails. By exploiting tokens designed for fast, convenient payments, launderers bypass many traditional banking controls, fragmenting illicit proceeds into smaller increments and complicating traceability. This is the primary risk because the technique revolves fundamentally around the token’s built-in characteristics and ease of transfer outside regulated channels.
- [Fictitious Trading across Jurisdictions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0069.001) —   Secondary vulnerability arises from the complex nature of trade finance instruments (e.g., letters of credit, documentary collections), which rely heavily on documentary compliance. Falsified invoices and bills of lading can go undetected due to the difficulty of verifying cross-border shipments and valuation, allowing criminals to layer illicit funds under the guise of legitimate trade.
- [Fictitious Foreign Investment](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0061.001) —   Secondary vulnerability arises from the misuse of specialized fiduciary or mutual trust fund arrangements intended for foreign investments. These structures permit the pooling of multiple participants’ funds and conceal the ultimate ownership, blending illegal cash flows with legitimate assets under the guise of foreign capital injections.
- [Cheque Fraud](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144.010) —   Criminals exploit the inherent vulnerabilities of checks—specifically float periods and delayed clearing—by depositing worthless or altered checks and rapidly withdrawing or transferring funds before the checks are returned unpaid. This is the primary vulnerability enabling this check fraud technique.
- [Investment Through CBI/RBI](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0061.002) —   Real estate and business investments are integral to the official CBI/RBI program pathway, enabling criminals to inflate property values or misrepresent investment amounts. Once thresholds are met, partial refunds conceal the true sum of illicit funds introduced. This inherent vulnerability in real estate and business transactions allows for disguising criminal proceeds under legitimate investment vehicles.
- [Trade Diversion](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0030) —   Criminals manipulate trade finance instruments (e.g., letters of credit, invoices, bills of lading) to misrepresent shipments and disguise the movement of illicit funds. The complexity of these products and documentation processes allows for hidden layering and supports the misreporting of values or goods in trade diversion schemes.
- [Fictitious Mergers or Acquisitions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0130.001) —   Fictitious M&A exploits the inherent vulnerabilities in large-scale corporate acquisition transactions. Criminals manipulate subjective valuations and present fraudulent financials, making otherwise questionable capital flows appear legitimate as 'deal proceeds.'
- [Multiple Invoicing](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0008.001) —   By duplicating documentation within trade finance, criminals can extract multiple credit or payment streams, obscuring the underlying financial flows.
- [Illegal Logging](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0145.001) —   Trade finance instruments (e.g., letters of credit) and misinvoicing practices are exploited to disguise illegal timber shipments and launder proceeds. The reliance on shipping documents, invoices, and cross-border transactions creates inherent vulnerabilities, allowing criminals to mask the origin of funds tied to unauthorized logging.
- [Crypto ATM Mule](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0011.002) —   Criminals exploit the anonymity and minimal KYC features inherent in crypto ATM services. By requiring little to no identification, these machines allow rapid placement and layering of illicit cash into cryptocurrency, bypassing standard AML scrutiny. This is the primary risk because the technique relies on the product’s limited oversight and anonymity-enhancing features to obscure transactional origins and beneficiaries.
- [Wildlife Trafficking](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0145.002) —   Proceeds are often commingled with legitimate trade or business revenues to mask their illicit origin. By integrating transactions into normal commercial flows, criminals exploit financial products and services designed for legitimate trade, making it harder to distinguish illicit funds.
- [Early Surrender](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0086.001) —   This technique exploits insurance products by allowing criminals to make structured or over-inflated premium payments and then surrender the policy early. The resulting payout appears as a standard insurance disbursement, effectively integrating illicit funds despite surrender penalties. The core vulnerability lies in the product’s flexible premium and refund features, which can bypass typical AML scrutiny when ownership details and premium sources appear to comply with standard insurance processes.
- [Tokenized Fundraisings](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144.013) —   This technique relies on under- or unregulated tokenized fundraising vehicles (ICOs, IDOs) as the primary vulnerability. Criminals exploit the inherent features of these offerings—such as minimal investor protections, lack of standardized disclosures, and ease of issuing tokens—to either fraudulently raise fresh illicit proceeds (via exit scams or misleading promotions) or to integrate preexisting tainted funds. Once tokens are sold, offenders can swiftly abandon the project or convert raised assets into other cryptocurrencies or fiat, allowing them to obscure the source of funds.
- [Real Estate Auction](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0108.001) —   Real estate auctions present a central vulnerability, as they often allow large cash payments and minimal checks on beneficial ownership. Criminals exploit weak KYC processes or oversight at auction venues, enabling them to integrate illicit funds, use straw buyers, and repeatedly flip properties for layering. This inherent lack of transparency and robust due diligence in the auction process is the primary risk exploited by this technique.
- [Arbitration Settlement Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0046) —   Criminals exploit arbitration services, which often face minimal AML oversight, by disguising illicit fund movements as legitimate settlement awards. By staging or inflating these disputes, they leverage the pseudo-legal nature of arbitration proceedings—commonly outside standard AML compliance—to integrate illicit proceeds under a veneer of legitimacy.
- [Decentralized Mixers](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0003.002) —   Decentralized mixers are fundamentally anonymity-focused services with a non-custodial architecture and self-executing smart contracts that inherently thwart oversight. Criminals exploit these features to obscure fund flows and evade conventional AML controls, making product-level anonymity the primary vulnerability.
- [Inflated Transaction Pricing](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0008.002) —   Criminals exploit the inherent subjectivity of pricing within trade and invoicing products (e.g., letters of credit, invoice financing) by inflating the stated cost of goods or services. This over-invoicing creates surplus funds that appear legitimate, allowing illicit proceeds to be laundered through routine commercial transactions. This is the primary vulnerability, as it relies on the financial product’s dependence on declared invoice values without thorough verification of market pricing.
- [Offsetting Transactions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0102) —   Offsetting (wash or matched) trades exploit the inherent features of securities and similar instruments that allow near-simultaneous buy/sell orders with minimal net change in positions. By repeatedly cycling funds in this manner, criminals take advantage of the product’s fast-paced trading characteristics to layer illicit proceeds without generating genuine economic exposure or immediately raising suspicion.
- [Syndicated Trade Loan Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0078) —   Criminals exploit syndicated trade loans, a specialized financial product involving multiple participating lenders. The fragmented oversight and shared responsibility in these arrangements allow them to inflate or fabricate trade documents, obscuring actual ownership and transaction values. This inherent product vulnerability—where co-lenders rely on minimal or delegated due diligence—constitutes the primary weakness exploited.
- [Bill of Exchange Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0074.001) —   Criminals primarily exploit the inherent vulnerabilities of bills of exchange—specialized trade finance instruments—by submitting falsified or inflated documentation, such as invoices and shipping records, to obtain credit or early payment. The paper-intensive nature of these products and the reliance on documentary verification allow illicit proceeds to be disguised as legitimate trade flows when repaying the bills of exchange.
- [Early Superannuation Withdrawals](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0109) —   Criminals exploit the early-withdrawal features of superannuation products by submitting falsified or forged medical or hardship documents. They rely on short processing windows that limit thorough verification. This vulnerability allows fraudulent payouts to appear as legitimate disbursements, making product risk the primary exposure exploited by this technique.
- [Immediate Cash Conversion](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0105) —   The core vulnerability lies in the inherent anonymity of physical cash and similar easily convertible instruments, such as gaming chips. Once funds are withdrawn or converted into cash, they become significantly harder to trace. Criminals repeatedly exploit this feature to bypass electronic monitoring and obscure the origin of illicit proceeds.
- [Renovation Cost Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0124) —   The technique exploits the inherent opaqueness of real estate transactions, especially renovation cost assessments, allowing criminals to inflate or fabricate invoices. By embedding illicit funds into the property's inflated renovation expenses, they leverage the high-value nature of the real estate product to obscure the original source of funds.
- [Asset Management Deposits](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0123) —   Criminals exploit the inherent complexity and multiple reinvestment options of cross-border asset management products to layer illicit funds. Large lump-sum deposits, segregated sub-accounts, and frequent transfers among affiliated entities obscure the funds’ origin, making product risk the central vulnerability in this technique.
- [Cross-Chain Token Wrapping](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0067.002) —   Wrapping and unwrapping tokens across different blockchains exploit gaps in AML oversight, as each network may have limited regulatory visibility.
- [Collectible Auction Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0045.002) —   Criminals exploit the inherent vulnerabilities of high-value collectible auctions, which often lack specialized AML checks and rely on highly subjective valuations. By artificially inflating or deflating collectible prices, layering multiple auction transactions, and justifying abrupt value changes as ‘market fluctuations,’ they obscure the illicit origin of funds and facilitate integration. This technique’s core weakness is tied to the product itself: auctions of unique or rare collectibles under minimal AML scrutiny.
- [Offshore Gambling Licenses](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0062.002) —   Criminal actors exploit anonymity-driven payment instruments, such as e-wallets and prepaid cards, to disguise the source of funds as gambling winnings. They leverage these instruments' inherent features, such as limited KYC and cross-border functionality, to further obscure transactional flows under the guise of legitimate gaming activity.
- [International Real Estate](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0010.003) —   Overseas real estate as a financial product often has fewer AML checks or disclosure requirements, allowing criminals to convert illicit funds into tangible assets under minimal scrutiny. By leveraging inherent gaps in real estate due diligence and oversight, they effectively obscure the illicit origin of proceeds.
- [Rental Income Schemes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0010.004) —   This technique exploits the inherent difficulties in verifying real estate rental income. Criminals introduce illicit funds as purported rent—often at inflated amounts or via falsified tenancy agreements—making it challenging for institutions to distinguish genuine property income from laundered proceeds. By commingling criminal earnings with legitimate rental flows, the real estate vulnerability is directly leveraged.
- [Document Forgery](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0012) —   Criminals leverage forged documents, such as shipping records, invoices, and financial statements, to bypass product-level due diligence controls that rely on authentic paperwork. By submitting falsified documentation to financial institutions or trade finance providers, they undermine verification and hide illicit flows under the guise of legitimate transactions. This represents the primary vulnerability exploited by document forgery.
- [Remote Mining](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0020.001) —   This technique primarily exploits the vulnerabilities inherent in remote or cloud-based mining services. Since these services often lack or have minimal AML controls, criminals can easily disguise illicit funds as hosting, equipment, or energy fees. Once newly minted coins are generated, they appear decoupled from the original dirty money, further complicating detection and undermining AML efforts.
- [Self-Hosted Cryptocurrency Wallets](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0034) —   Certain self-hosted wallets incorporate inherent privacy features (e.g., CoinJoin protocols, stealth addresses, zero-knowledge proofs) that obscure transactional data. These features further impede AML/CFT measures by complicating the attribution and freezing of illicit assets.
- [Fictitious Consulting Firm](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0014.003) —   The technique exploits intangible consulting services, which are easily fabricated and difficult to corroborate, to mask illicit payments as legitimate advisory fees. Unlike customer identity issues, this additional vulnerability arises from the inherent nature of professional consultancy services, which require minimal documentation and can obfuscate the true purposes of transactions.
- [Investment Fraud](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144.017) —   Fraudsters design or market deceptive investment products, such as Ponzi schemes and high-yield crypto tokens, that appear legitimate but lack real underlying value or regulatory oversight. Investors are lured by promises of above-market returns, unaware that their funds are diverted or used merely to perpetuate the scheme. This represents the primary vulnerability exploited, as the fraudulent product itself circumvents normal due diligence and creates immediate opportunities for illicit fund gathering and layering before detection.
- [Payroll Deduction Loan Repayment](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0029) —   This technique exploits the structured nature of loan products by using incremental payroll-based repayments to layer illicit funds. By synchronizing fake or genuine payroll deposits with formal loan installments, criminals obscure suspicious funding sources within what appears to be regular wage-based debt servicing.
- [Dividend Stripping](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0147.003) —   Criminals exploit the complexities in share-lending, short-selling, and dividend record processes to generate multiple overlapping tax refund claims. By timing trades around dividend dates, they create the appearance that multiple parties are entitled to the same dividend tax credit. This is the primary vulnerability enabling the direct generation of illicit proceeds from government funds.
- [Name Alteration](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0023.002) —   By physically or digitally altering the payee name on checks, this technique exploits the inherent reliance on accurate payee identification in the check-clearing process. Even minor name discrepancies can bypass typical verification controls, facilitating deposits under altered identities and evading flagged records.
- [Ghost Shipping](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0069.002) —   Ghost shipping exploits the inherent vulnerabilities of trade finance and related documentation-based products. Financial institutions often rely solely on bills of lading and invoices rather than physically verifying shipments. As a result, criminals can submit falsified records indicating cargo that never actually moves. This tactic enables the layering of illicit funds under the appearance of legitimate trade transactions, taking advantage of the product's document-centric processes.
- [Agricultural Ventures](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0014.004) —   Criminals exploit farmland and agribusiness operations as products and services with inherently less standardized scrutiny. By manipulating property valuations, reclassifying land, and leveraging government subsidies, they disguise the true source and value of illicit capital, blending illegal proceeds with legitimate agricultural flows. This is the primary vulnerability because it directly relies on the unique features and transaction characteristics of farmland, livestock, and agribusiness activities.
- [Metaverse-based Asset Transfers](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0066.001) —   The intangible and easily traded nature of metaverse-based digital assets (such as NFTs and virtual real estate) enables criminals to quickly buy and sell, exploit wash trading, and manipulate valuations. These inherent product features significantly obscure the trail of illicit funds, facilitating complex layering steps that detach proceeds from their criminal origins.
- [Governance Token Obfuscation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0067.003) —   Criminals exploit the unique features and incomplete regulatory classification of governance tokens (e.g., DAO voting or protocol control) to obscure beneficial ownership and complicate tracing. These inherent product characteristics allow for layering maneuvers and reduced transparency regarding the original source of funds, making product risk the central vulnerability.
- [Investment Companies](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0061.003) —   This technique primarily exploits vulnerabilities in private investment companies and private funds, which are not subject to the same AML scrutiny as publicly offered or retail funds. Criminals leverage this limited oversight to blend illicit proceeds with legitimate capital, layer funds through complex transactions, and obscure beneficial ownership. Ultimately, they present redeemed capital or gains as legitimate returns, circumventing detection and AML controls.
- [Chip Dumping](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107.003) —   Chip dumping exploits the vulnerability of gambling products, where chips (physical or virtual) can be transferred among players with insufficient oversight. Criminals collude to lose chips to a designated account, thereby masking illicit fund transfers as legitimate 'gaming' wins. This intrinsic feature of gambling products—facilitating chip exchange or wagers between players—provides the primary avenue for laundering.
- [All-Cash Real Estate Transactions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0010.005) —   All-cash real estate deals exploit the inherent vulnerabilities of the real estate product itself, as these transactions commonly avoid mortgage-based due diligence. By sidestepping standard financial institution scrutiny, criminals can inject illicit funds directly, making real estate a primary vehicle for integrating illicit proceeds with minimal oversight.
- [DeFi Transactions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0067.004) —   Criminals exploit the inherent anonymity and decentralized nature of DeFi protocols, where centralized compliance checks are largely absent, self-custody prevails, and KYC requirements are minimal. By repeatedly swapping, staking, and bridging tokens across multiple blockchains, they layer illicit proceeds while evading traditional AML monitoring. This is the core vulnerability exploited by this technique.
- [Insurance Policy Overfunding](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0090.002) —   The technique exploits insurance products, particularly single-premium and investment-linked policies, that allow large or repeated premium payments, flexible top-ups, and early withdrawals. Criminals overfund policies with illicit money, then request partial surrenders presented as legitimate refunds or disbursements. The inherent product features, such as ease of overpayment and routine early redemption, serve as the primary vulnerability that facilitates the layering and integration of illicit funds.
- [Cryptojacking](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0020.002) —   Through cryptojacking, criminals generate newly minted cryptocurrency entirely outside regulated financial products, bypassing AML scrutiny until assets are ultimately exchanged or converted. This technique exploits the unregulated nature of cryptomining, enabling illicit fund accumulation without the typical AML checks that would apply to regulated or monitored products.
- [Export Overvaluation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0147.004) —   Overvalued exports exploit trade finance instruments, such as letters of credit and documentary collections, and depend on self-reported invoice values. Inflated documentation is accepted at face value, resulting in unwarranted proceeds being billed as legitimate export transactions without adequate verification of the true product worth.
- [Market Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0094) —   Market manipulation exploits inherent vulnerabilities in trading and investment products where price and volume signals are relied upon to reflect genuine market activity. Criminals can artificially inflate prices, trading volumes, or market sentiment (e.g., via wash trading or pump-and-dump) to disguise illicit proceeds as legitimate gains, demonstrating how these product features—absent robust oversight—are specifically targeted.
- [Investment Fund Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0097) —   Criminals exploit the inherent vulnerabilities of specialized investment vehicles, such as private equity and hedge funds, by falsifying performance metrics and reclassifying large infusions of illicit capital as legitimate investments. By manipulating investor data and fund records, they obscure beneficial ownership and transactional details under the guise of routine fund operations. This is the primary risk because the technique fundamentally relies on these complex, opaque products to integrate illicit proceeds into the financial system as standard investment flows, circumventing typical AML scrutiny.
- [Negotiable Instrument Purchases](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0110) —   Criminals exploit the inherent trust, portability, and wide acceptance of negotiable instruments (e.g., cashier’s checks, money orders, traveler’s checks). By structuring each purchase under reporting thresholds and distributing transactions across multiple branch locations, they avoid the usual red flags associated with large cash deposits. This vulnerability is central to the technique, enabling illicit funds to enter the financial system under the guise of legitimate payment instruments.
- [Electronic Gaming Machine Ticket Redemption](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0054) —   Criminals exploit the TITO-based gaming product feature that converts large volumes of physical cash into vouchers with minimal recorded betting activity. By repeatedly inserting illicit funds into gaming machines and quickly cashing out TITO tickets, they mask the true origin of the proceeds under the guise of legitimate gambling winnings. This is the primary vulnerability because the product’s structure and limited scrutiny for individual TITO transactions enable swift conversion and redemption of illicit cash, making it appear legitimate.
- [Commingling Environmental Crime Proceeds](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0057) —   Criminals primarily exploit trade and commercial product vulnerabilities by falsifying documentation (e.g., trade invoices), misrepresenting product origin or quantities, and embedding illicitly harvested resources within legitimate supply chains. These measures leverage trade finance complexities to commingle illegal proceeds from environmental crimes and disguise them as routine commercial transactions.
- [Virtual IBANs](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0027) —   Criminals exploit the inherent features of virtual IBANs—specifically, the ability to generate multiple IBAN-like references that all route to a single underlying account—thereby obscuring the true beneficiary and complicating AML controls. The standard IBAN-style format creates a product vulnerability by misleading financial institutions’ monitoring systems and frustrating beneficial ownership checks. This enables layering with reduced KYC oversight at the virtual reference level.
- [Trade-based Transaction Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0111) —   Criminals misrepresent or forge documentation related to trade finance products (e.g., letters of credit, documentary collections, invoice financing) to legitimize inflated, understated, or even fictitious trade transactions. These inherent vulnerabilities in trade finance instruments—particularly the heavy reliance on documentary evidence—are exploited to embed illicit funds within nominally valid commercial frameworks.
- [Insurance and Reinsurance Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0090) —   This technique primarily exploits the inherent features of insurance and reinsurance products, allowing criminals to inflate premiums, fabricate or exaggerate claims, and shuffle funds through multiple contractual layers. These open-ended or flexible product structures obscure illicit proceeds among normal policy transactions before they resurface as seemingly legitimate payouts or settlements.
- [Forging or Altering Financial Instruments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0126) —   Criminals exploit specialized financial instruments (e.g., letters of credit, checks, promissory notes) by forging or altering key details relied upon for authenticity. By doing so, they circumvent standard verification or validation protocols inherent in these products, enabling illicit funds to appear legitimate. This vulnerability is central to the technique, as tampered or fabricated documents hamper clear AML scrutiny and allow layering through apparently credible instruments.
- [Insurance Beneficiary Substitution](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0089) —   Criminals exploit single-premium or investment-based insurance products, which allow large lump-sum inflows, to quickly place and layer illicit funds through frequent policy changes, redemptions, and beneficiary substitutions.
- [Mirror Trading](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0101) —   Capital market instruments used for mirrored trades can bypass common AML thresholds for deposits or wires.
- [Ransomware Payments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0049.001) —   This technique exploits the inherent pseudonymity and decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, facilitating the rapid movement of ransomware proceeds across newly generated wallet addresses, mixing services, privacy-focused coins, and cross-chain mechanisms. These core product features fundamentally impede straightforward tracing and constitute the primary vulnerability leveraged by adversaries.
- [Circular Letters of Credit](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0071) —   The core vulnerability lies in the manipulation of letters of credit—a specific trade finance product—to circulate illicit funds in a closed loop. By issuing interlocking letters of credit among shell companies, criminals exploit the fact that each bank sees only one segment of the transaction, allowing them to disguise the absence of genuine trade while layering proceeds.
- [In-Person Gambling Imitation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107) —   Criminals exploit the inherent vulnerabilities of gambling products and services, specifically the ability to convert large amounts of cash or electronic funds into chips and betting credits with minimal oversight. By placing only minimal wagers—or otherwise structuring bets to maintain most of the funds—and then redeeming chips or credits as winnings, they effectively disguise illicit cash as legitimate gambling proceeds.
- [Crypto ATMs](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0063) —   Once physical cash is converted into cryptocurrency through these kiosks, criminals exploit the anonymity-enabling features of digital assets. The ease of transferring crypto across multiple wallets or jurisdictions obscures transaction trails and complicates AML efforts, constituting an inherent vulnerability of the product itself.
- [Cash Deposits](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0004) —   This technique exploits the inherent vulnerability of deposit accounts that accept physical cash with limited oversight. Criminals structure or stagger deposits below regulatory thresholds, making it more difficult for institutions to detect illicit proceeds when monitoring product usage alone.
- [Business Investment](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0036) —   Lightly regulated investment vehicles, such as certain private equity or real estate structures, are exploited because they allow capital contributions with limited scrutiny of ultimate beneficial owners. Criminals leverage these products' inherent opacity to present illicit funds as legitimate investment contributions and returns.
- [Trade Finance Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0074) —   Criminals exploit the specialized nature of trade finance instruments (e.g., letters of credit, pre-shipment loans) by submitting falsified or inflated documentation. This allows them to obtain or move funds under the guise of ostensibly legitimate trade finance products, making it a primary vulnerability that facilitates large-scale layering of illicit proceeds.
- [Construction Project Schemes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0010.001) —   Criminals exploit large construction and property development undertakings to launder illicit funds under ostensibly legitimate project expenses. By inflating costs, routing payments through shell subcontractors, and mixing illicit proceeds with real development budgets, they capitalize on the substantial capital flows and complex cost structures inherent to these projects. This masks the true origin of funds, making real estate and construction-based transactions appear routine while hiding illicit financial activity.
- [Pre-Shipment Finance Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0072) —   Criminals exploit short-term pre-shipment finance—often referred to as packing credits or working capital loans—by submitting inflated or fictitious export orders and shipping documents, which are accepted at face value as collateral. The product’s reliance on anticipated export proceeds allows them to repay these loans with illicit funds disguised as legitimate revenue, effectively merging illegal money into normal trade flows without rigorous verification of actual shipments or buyer legitimacy.
- [Burn and Mint Transfers](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0005.001) —   Criminals leverage the inherent properties of stablecoins and wrapped tokens to further complicate tracing. These products facilitate cross-chain interoperability, allowing seamless burning and re-minting while maintaining peg values or backed assets. Their design features reduce volatility risk and can camouflage illicit transactions, making it harder for investigators to follow the funds' provenance.
- [Licensed Betting Shop Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107.002) —   Criminals exploit the inherently cash-heavy nature of licensed betting shops and the inconsistent monitoring of face-to-face wagers. By structuring bets below reporting thresholds and disguising illicit funds as legitimate gambling winnings, the product’s operational vulnerabilities are directly targeted.
- [Chargeback](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0091) —   Criminals exploit the built-in chargeback and refund mechanisms of credit card and payment products to reverse transactions, masking illicit proceeds as returned funds. By manipulating legitimate dispute policies and thresholds, they add an extra layer of complexity that conceals the original source of the money. This inherent product vulnerability is central to the laundering scheme.
- [Custodial Mixers](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0003.001) —   Custodial mixers function as a specialized service that centralizes user deposits under a single operator, providing anonymity and bypassing standard AML scrutiny. Criminals exploit the product's inherent commingling and opaque withdrawal process to obscure the provenance of funds and evade detection.
- [Casino Mule Networks](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0011.003) —   Criminals exploit the inherent vulnerabilities in casino gambling services—particularly threshold-based cash reporting and minimal chip-tracking—to deposit illicit funds, purchase chips, and rapidly redeem checks with little gameplay. This core product-level weakness is central to how the technique conceals and legitimizes illicit cash through casinos.
- [Red/Green Clause Letters of Credit](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0074.002) —   Criminals exploit the specialized features of red/green clause letters of credit (partial or advance payment) by inflating invoices and fabricating supporting documentation. This exploitation leverages the product’s inherent mechanism for disbursement before verification of actual shipment, enabling offenders to secure illicit funds under a veneer of legitimate trade. Falsified or overstated cargo volumes justify early payouts, facilitating layering and obscuring the illicit source of proceeds.
- [Multi-Currency Swap](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0115.002) —   Multi-currency financial services offer rapid currency conversions with limited traceability, creating ideal conditions for layering. Criminals exploit these features to continually fragment and re-route illicit funds, making it more difficult for investigators to trace transactions back to their origin. This vulnerability is compounded by the jurisdictional aspect, enabling repeated conversion steps across different denominations.
- [Sector-Specific Document Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0012.003) —   This technique exploits the inherent documentation requirements of certain financial or trade-related products. Criminals submit fabricated sector-specific paperwork, such as compliance certificates or shipping manifests, tied to trade finance or regulated product transactions. This allows them to appear fully compliant with product-level checks and avoid detection. This constitutes a distinct secondary vulnerability, separate from purely jurisdictional concerns.
- [Casino Chip Conversions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107.006) —   Criminals exploit the inherent features of casino chips and TITO tickets, which allow easy conversion from physical cash into gambling credits and back again with minimal scrutiny. By engaging in minimal or staged wagering, they can redeem chips or vouchers as purported winnings, effectively masking the illicit source of the funds. This vulnerability is tied to the product’s design, wherein large cash buy-ins and quick redemptions are not always flagged, enabling criminals to pass off illicit proceeds as legitimate gaming returns.
- [Diamond-based Trade Transactions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0055.002) —   Criminals exploit the subjective valuation, portability, and ease of re-exporting of diamonds as core vulnerabilities. By falsifying import documents, repeatedly inflating declared diamond values, and rotating the same parcels across borders, they obscure the true transaction amounts and origins. The opaque pricing inherent to diamonds enables continuous layering within trade finance and banking channels.
- [Cash Wage Payments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0052) —   By relying on physical cash, an anonymity-enabling medium, criminals avoid standard banking channels and associated AML controls. This facilitates clandestine wage payments that obscure the true origin of funds.
- [Trade Misinvoicing](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0008.003) —   Trade misinvoicing primarily exploits vulnerabilities inherent in trade finance products. By relying heavily on self-reported valuations and documentation (e.g., invoices, bills of lading) with limited physical or external validation, criminals can falsify the stated value or quantity of goods. This allows illicit funds to be embedded and layered within seemingly legitimate transactions, making it the central operational vulnerability.
- [Precious Commodity Smuggling](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0048.003) —   Criminals exploit the high value-to-weight ratio and fungibility of precious metals or gemstones to consolidate large sums in small, easily concealed forms. These inherent characteristics of the commodities—allowing value to be concealed, quickly transported, and later sold or used as collateral—significantly reduce detection compared to conventional financial transactions.
- [Foreign Exchange Manipulation in Trade](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0081) —   Criminals exploit the structural features of trade finance instruments and derivatives to manipulate invoice values, obscure actual currency exchange rates, and embed illicit proceeds within ostensibly legitimate trade settlements.
- [Invoice Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0008) —   Invoice manipulation directly exploits vulnerabilities in trade finance products, including letters of credit and invoice financing. Criminals fabricate or overstate invoices and shipping documents, leveraging the reliance on supporting paperwork to legitimize illicit proceeds as ordinary trade flows. This is the primary vulnerability, as falsified documentation bypasses standard AML scrutiny inherent to trade finance.
- [Art Market Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0045.003) —   This technique primarily exploits the inherent vulnerabilities of high-value art transactions—namely subjective valuations, private sales with limited regulatory scrutiny, and acceptance of large cash payments—to obscure the origins of illicit funds. These characteristics of the art market itself facilitate the layering and integration of criminal proceeds.
- [Shipping Document Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0069) —   Criminals exploit the reliance on shipping documents within trade finance—bills of lading, invoices, and manifests—to secure financing or clear customs for nonexistent or misrepresented goods. The inherent complexity and volume of trade finance transactions often lead to limited scrutiny, allowing forged or inflated documentation to pass undetected. As a result, illicit operators can layer funds under the guise of legitimate trade transactions, capitalizing on the vulnerability to document-based fraud.
- [Chain Hop](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0005) —   Relies on cross-chain bridging or swapping protocols that may lack consistent AML controls across networks.
- [Protection Payments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0049.002) —   Criminals use standard business bank accounts and high-cash-flow services to co-mingle extortion proceeds with ordinary revenue. Frequent, unremarkable cash deposits, presented as legitimate business earnings, exploit product-based vulnerabilities by reducing visibility into suspicious transactions linked to extortion schemes.
- [Captive Insurance](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0090.001) —   Criminals exploit captive insurance as a specialized financial product by controlling both the insurer and the insured, funneling illicit proceeds through inflated premiums or fabricated claims. This self-contained structure inherently obscures the origin of funds and facilitates layering and integration steps, making the product's complexity the primary vulnerability.
- [Smurfing](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0016.005) —   Smurfing primarily exploits vulnerabilities in threshold-based deposit or payment products. By splitting large sums into multiple below-threshold transactions, criminals circumvent standard product-driven reporting and monitoring triggers, making this the central operational vulnerability.
- [Junket-based Casino Transfers](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107.004) —   VIP junket packages represent a specialized service that allows large, loosely verified transactions to bypass standard monitoring thresholds. Off-book credit extensions and private debt settlements within these packages create a high-risk product environment vulnerable to exploitation.
- [Pension Fund Contributions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0037) —   Criminals exploit the unique features of pension or superannuation products, such as large permitted deposits disguised as retirement savings, multiple rollovers across institutions, and eventual withdrawals appearing as legitimate pension disbursements. These characteristics facilitate layering and integration if oversight of contributions and beneficiary withdrawals is weak.
- [Fictitious Jewelry Business](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0014.005) —   Criminals exploit the high-value nature and subjective pricing of jewelry and precious metals to launder funds as purported commercial sales. By inflating or deflating valuations, fabricating invoices, and blending illicit proceeds with bogus revenue, they leverage product features that allow large transaction volumes with fewer immediate red flags. This is the primary vulnerability the technique exploits.
- [Circular Transactions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0039) —   In addition to leveraging jurisdictional mismatches, this technique exploits vulnerabilities inherent in trade finance, shipping, and related financial products. Criminals repeatedly re-invoice or fabricate shipments, manipulate letters of credit, and cycle funds through trade instruments or gambling services. The opaque processes and documentation requirements of these products provide distinct opportunities to conduct circular transactions without legitimate economic activity.
- [Bond Investments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0061.004) —   Criminals exploit the widely recognized stability and legitimacy of bonds, including insurance-based bond products, to allow large amounts of illicit capital to blend in with normal investment flows. Since these instruments are viewed as safe, suspicious capital inflows are less likely to be flagged. Additionally, interest or redemption proceeds can be presented as ordinary returns, further obscuring the illicit origin.
- [Service Contract Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0098) —   This technique primarily exploits the intangible nature of service-based transactions, such as consulting, licensing, and management. It allows criminals to inflate or fabricate contract values with minimal verification of actual deliverables. By labeling illicit proceeds as legitimate fees for subjective services, offenders obscure the true origin of funds and seamlessly integrate them into normal commerce.
- [Match-Fixing](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107.005) —   Match-fixing exploits the inherent vulnerabilities of sports-betting products, where rigged events guarantee winning wagers that appear legitimate. By manipulating the outcome, criminals obscure the original illicit funds behind seemingly lawful gambling profits.
- [Real Estate Escrow Flip](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0010.006) —   Criminals exploit the inherent vulnerabilities of real estate transactions and escrow processes to quickly flip properties and obscure the origin of funds. The escrow structure, widely trusted as a neutral third party, reduces scrutiny of large deposits, multiple disbursements, and rapid turnover. This allows illicit funds to be layered and integrated under the guise of legitimate real estate sales.
- [Utility Tokens](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0067.005) —   Criminals exploit the inherent features and partial AML coverage of utility tokens—especially their anonymity-friendly design, cross-chain bridging capabilities, and minimal oversight in many decentralized ecosystems—to layer illicit funds. By repeatedly swapping or bridging these tokens, offenders obscure ownership and transactional records, taking advantage of the product’s lack of clear regulatory classification to hinder investigations.
- [Illegal Mining & Mineral Trafficking](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0145.003) —   Criminals exploit the inherent fungibility and ease of commingling precious metals by blending illicitly mined ore with lawfully sourced stock. By merging the two, they obscure the illegal origin of the minerals and introduce proceeds into the legitimate market, making this the central vulnerability targeted by the technique.
- [Ponzi Schemes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144.019) —   Ponzi schemes exploit the vulnerabilities inherent in purported high-return investment products. Criminals commingle new investor capital with illicit funds, portraying these as legitimate returns. This setup masks the true origin of the money and perpetuates the fraud, making it exceedingly difficult for financial institutions and authorities to distinguish genuine investments from criminal proceeds.

- [Virtual Companies](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0127) —   Criminals incorporate these virtual entities in secrecy-friendly or loosely regulated jurisdictions, exploiting cross-border AML gaps to obscure oversight. By swiftly shifting or dissolving these companies across multiple regions, they further impede regulators' ability to trace ownership, constituting a secondary but distinct vulnerability.
- [Misappropriation of Public Funds](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0051.001) —   Many perpetrators move stolen government funds across borders through offshore accounts or by incorporating shell companies in secrecy jurisdictions with lax AML controls. This cross-border element deliberately capitalizes on disparate regulatory environments to conceal the illicit origins of funds and frustrate investigators.
- [Commodity Smuggling](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0048) —   Commodity smuggling inherently leverages cross-border vulnerabilities, where inconsistent customs regulations, porous land borders, and uneven AML enforcement allow illicit goods to flow with minimal scrutiny. Criminals exploit these jurisdictional gaps to evade duties, obscure shipment origins, and layer proceeds internationally, making it exceedingly difficult for authorities to track illicit funds. This cross-border dimension is the central operational vulnerability exploited by this technique.
- [Precious Commodity Smuggling](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0048.003) —   This technique exploits cross-border vulnerabilities by moving precious commodities into jurisdictions with lax or uneven AML enforcement. Criminals rely on weak customs oversight, minimal reporting requirements, and inconsistent regulations to evade detection and oversight when smuggling high-value metals or gemstones.
- [Foreign Exchange Manipulation in Trade](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0081) —   The technique's primary vulnerability is the exploitation of multiple jurisdictions with weaker AML regimes or capital controls. Criminals route foreign exchange transactions and partial or advanced payments through these regions, creating a fragmented paper trail that undermines consistent oversight and facilitates hidden value transfers.
- [Invoice Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0008) —   Cross-border falsified trade documentation exploits the differing controls across multiple jurisdictions, creating opportunities for the undetected movement of illicit proceeds.
- [Art Market Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0045.003) —   Free-trade zones and offshore jurisdictions with weak AML enforcement create an environment where art assets can be stored, traded, or transferred with minimal oversight. This enables further anonymity and complicates law enforcement efforts.
- [Captive Insurance](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0090.001) —   These captive insurers are often established in offshore or lightly regulated jurisdictions, such as Bermuda or The Bahamas, where they exploit secrecy laws and weak AML enforcement to hinder oversight. The offshore location further obscures beneficial ownership and transactions, enhancing the technique's effectiveness.
- [Disguised Remittance Transfers](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0040.001) —   Offenders route disguised remittance transfers to or from jurisdictions with weak AML controls or outside typical migrant corridors to further obscure the funds' true origins, leveraging minimal oversight of charitable or familial transactions.
- [Cross-Border Agent Intermediation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0121.001) —   Criminals exploit multiple jurisdictions with inconsistent or weaker AML controls, fragmenting oversight to evade detection. By deploying local fixers and sub-agents across borders, they exploit weak points in each jurisdiction’s defenses, ensuring that no single country’s AML regime can comprehensively detect or stop the illicit fund movements.
- [Junket-based Casino Transfers](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107.004) —   This technique primarily exploits cross-border vulnerabilities across multiple jurisdictions with inconsistent AML controls. By leveraging junket operators who operate internationally, criminals can layer funds across different regulatory environments, impeding uniform oversight and enforcement.
- [Transaction Chaining](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0070) —   By rapidly moving funds among different countries and regulatory environments, criminals exploit inconsistencies in AML enforcement across multiple jurisdictions. This cross-border complexity frustrates investigators' ability to follow the transaction trail and ensure consistent compliance checks.
- [Onion over VPN](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0015.005) —   DEXs can be accessed globally, allowing cross-border transactions that bypass local AML rules and obscure the geographic trail of fund movements.
- [CBI or RBI-Based Identity Acquisition](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0024.001) —   CBI/RBI schemes often operate in countries with limited oversight or weak AML enforcement, enabling criminals to "forum shop" for jurisdictions where scrutiny of applicants' backgrounds and sources of funds is minimal. By securing official documents from such jurisdictions, launderers further exploit cross-border anonymity and regulatory gaps to move illicit wealth undetected.
- [Circular Transactions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0039) —   Criminals exploit multi-jurisdictional complexity and mismatched AML enforcement frameworks to obscure the provenance of funds. By repeatedly transferring capital across borders—often in secrecy or offshore jurisdictions—they frustrate authorities' ability to trace transactions and identify beneficial owners. This reliance on cross-border fragmentation is the core vulnerability enabling the circular flow of illicit proceeds.
- [Entertainment Venture Fronts](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0014.006) —   Criminals often operate across multiple jurisdictions with varying AML standards, using offshore structures, foreign partners, or cross-border licensing deals. These multi-jurisdictional transactions and layered contracts complicate efforts to track ultimate beneficiaries, thereby exploiting weak links in global AML enforcement.
- [Asset Cloaking](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0009) —   By leveraging secrecy-friendly or low-transparency jurisdictions with weak AML oversight, criminals further hinder law enforcement inquiries. Incorporation in offshore havens and layering entities across multiple regions amplify opacity, making investigations and asset tracing significantly more difficult.
- [Mobile Payment Systems](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0134.002) —   Criminals deliberately exploit the inconsistent or weaker AML/CFT rules of multiple jurisdictions for non-bank mobile payment operators. By routing funds through countries with lax controls, they reduce the likelihood of detection and take advantage of regulatory arbitrage to fragment transaction trails.
- [Political Contributions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0056) —   Offshore or foreign shell entities and accounts are used to route political contributions and lobbying payments, taking advantage of weaker disclosure mandates or inconsistent campaign finance regulations. This cross-border dimension enables launderers to mask the origin of funds and avoid scrutiny, exploiting jurisdictions with lax AML oversight which are particularly vulnerable.
- [Court System Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0047) —   This technique relies on bribery or coercion of court officials and the exploitation of weak or corrupt judicial frameworks. Criminals secure fraudulent legal rulings or manipulate legal procedures, such as delaying asset-freezing orders, in jurisdictions where oversight is insufficient or corruption is tolerated. This allows them to legitimize illicit funds and evade enforcement.
- [Service Contract Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0098) —   Entities are often established in or routed through secrecy-prone locales, exploiting weak AML oversight and impeding cross-border investigations. This deliberate use of offshore jurisdictions heightens anonymity and further complicates the tracing of illicit funds.
- [Educational Institution Schemes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0019.001) —   The technique involves using cross-border donations, grants, and student payments that pass through multiple jurisdictions. Criminals target regions with weaker AML oversight or regulatory gaps to further obscure the origin and destination of illicit funds, taking advantage of inconsistent enforcement and reduced transparency.
- [Peel Chain](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0070.002) —   Funds may move through crypto-friendly but weakly regulated jurisdictions to exploit gaps in enforcement.
- [In-Game Currency & Microtransaction Exploits](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0066.003) —   Some cross-border in-game currency transactions deliberately involve jurisdictions with lax AML regulations. Indicator #5948 highlights high-volume transfers to and from regions known for weak oversight, adding a distinct element of regulatory arbitrage.
- [Deceptive Tax Filings](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0014.007) —   Offshore subsidiaries or shell companies are established in low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions, exploiting weak reporting standards to facilitate deceptive tax filings. These regions enable minimal disclosure of beneficial owners, further obscuring the true origin of criminal proceeds.
- [Daigou Networks](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0013.006) —   Daigou networks primarily exploit mismatched regulatory regimes and capital controls across borders. By leveraging differences in AML enforcement and import restrictions between jurisdictions, they obscure beneficial ownership and conceal cross-border value transfers. This core cross-border vulnerability is central to their operations.
- [Utility Tokens](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0067.005) —   Because certain jurisdictions do not classify utility tokens under full AML scrutiny, criminals engage in regulatory arbitrage by operating in or routing funds through regions with weaker or no oversight. This further conceals illicit asset origins and hinders law enforcement efforts.
- [Illegal Mining & Mineral Trafficking](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0145.003) —   Criminals exploit regions with weak enforcement or corruption to operate unauthorized mines and fabricate or omit required documentation. These lax regulatory environments enable them to conceal true production volumes and bypass standard licensing or permitting controls.

- [Misappropriation of Public Funds](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0051.001) —   The technique exploits internal vulnerabilities within an organization, such as weak internal controls and oversight, enabling trusted individuals to misappropriate funds without immediate detection.
- [Government Relief Program Fraud](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144.004) —   Collusion with complicit insiders or public officials within government agencies represents a distinct governance weakness exploited by offenders. Criminals take advantage of these insiders to override or bypass standard checks, drastically reducing the effectiveness of routine application and eligibility verifications.
- [Counterfeit Currency](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0092) —   Financial institutions' operational weaknesses, such as inadequate staff training, reluctance to challenge suspicious cash, or poor currency-handling procedures, create an environment where forged notes can go undetected. These deficiencies enable counterfeit currency to enter the system more easily.
- [Complicit or Controlled FIs](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0082) —   Criminals take over or establish MSBs and subvert their internal governance. By installing complicit or corrupt compliance staff, they ensure suspicious transactions go unreported and bypass standard AML controls. The technique’s core vulnerability lies in compromised oversight and active manipulation of internal control frameworks.
- [Micro-Structuring](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0016.001) —   Criminals exploit the fact that many institutions' AML systems do not aggregate or correlate a high volume of micro-transactions in real time. These gaps in monitoring technologies and procedures allow coordinated sub-threshold deposits and withdrawals to proceed without triggering alerts, reflecting an internal operational vulnerability.
- [Licensed Betting Shop Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107.002) —   In some cases, employees collude with criminals or manipulate records, bypassing AML checks. Local staff dependencies, insider overrides of identity verification, and potential criminal ownership of the betting shop reflect governance and oversight gaps.
- [Syndicated Trade Loan Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0078) —   Collusion by specific lender representatives and insufficient independent checks at participating banks enable criminals to bypass internal controls.
