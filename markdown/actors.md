# Actors

## [Insurance Company](https://framework.amltrix.com/actors/AT0002)

**Description:**
Organizations that underwrite and issue insurance policies, collecting premiums and paying claims in the event of covered losses. They may operate directly or through intermediaries.

### Related Techniques
- [Beneficial Ownership Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0088) — Criminals exploit insurance companies by frequently changing policyholders or named beneficiaries. This constant reshuffling conceals the individual who ultimately benefits from claims or payouts, impeding financial institutions' ability to determine the policy's real owner.
- [Bond Investments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0061.004) — Insurance companies issue bond-like insurance products that criminals misuse by:

- Offering insurance-based investment instruments where illicit funds are stored under an insurance wrapper.
- Allowing redemption and interest proceeds to appear as standard policy benefits, further complicating the detection of illicit origins.
- [Insurance Policy Overfunding](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0090.002) — Insurance companies are used as conduits for overfunding schemes. Criminals:

- Purchase or maintain policies that permit large or repeated contributions.
- Disguise surpluses or refunds as legitimate payouts or early surrenders.

These transactions often appear routine, impeding financial institutions' ability to identify illicit origins, especially when policy terms naturally allow flexible premium and withdrawal options.
- [Piracy](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0148) — Insurance companies are compelled to cover ransom payments for hijacked vessels or crews, inadvertently becoming part of piracy-related transactions. Criminals swiftly move these payouts through unregulated channels, complicating financial institutions' ability to track or identify suspicious activity.
- [Insurance Beneficiary Substitution](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0089) — Insurance companies issue and administer policies that criminals exploit by repeatedly substituting beneficiaries or policyholders. They:

- Provide high-value or single-premium insurance products that can be rapidly funded and redeemed to layer illicit proceeds.
- Face compliance challenges when policy details change frequently without credible justification, impeding effective AML monitoring.
- [Captive Insurance](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0090.001) — Criminals form or exploit a self-owned insurance company (captive insurer) to:

- Inflate premiums or fabricate claims, creating complex layers of transactions that hinder AML scrutiny.
- Facilitate the final integration of illicit funds as seemingly legitimate insurance reimbursements.
- [Offshore Insurance Schemes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0085) — Offshore insurance companies are formed or acquired by illicit actors to facilitate money laundering by:

- Issuing policies in jurisdictions with minimal transparency, making it difficult to trace premium sources.
- Accepting large premium payments that intermix legitimate and illicit funds, enabling layering.
- Paying out claims or surrender values that appear lawful, masking the criminal origin of assets.

Weak regulatory oversight in these locales hinders financial institutions’ ability to identify ultimate beneficiaries or verify the legitimacy of transactions.
- [Early Surrender](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0086.001) — Insurance companies are exploited for this technique by:

- Accepting premium payments, even if suspiciously structured or from unknown third parties, and processing early surrenders as standard disbursements.
- Generating payouts that appear as legitimate insurance refunds, enabling the layering and integration of criminal proceeds.
- Overlooking inconsistencies in policy ownership or payment sources, which adds to the difficulty of identifying money-laundering indicators.
- [Insurance Annuities](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0087) — Insurance companies issue annuity contracts, which criminals exploit by depositing illicit funds as premiums. They may be unaware of suspicious overfunding or the use of third parties with no clear relationship to the policyholder. Repeated early surrenders and ownership transfers can appear as routine transactions, complicating financial institutions' detection of illicit origins.
- [Insurance and Reinsurance Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0090) — Criminals exploit or create insurance companies, including fraudulent offshore entities, by:

- Inflating premiums, faking or overstating claims, and channeling illicit funds as routine policy transactions.
- Using complex or layered cross-border reinsurance deals that obscure beneficial ownership and payment trails.

Ultimately, payouts from these manipulated policies blend illicit capital with legitimate insurance proceeds, hindering financial institutions' efforts to detect the underlying criminal source.

### Related Techniques
- [E-commerce & Marketplace Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0028) — Criminals use their own or stolen cardholder details to perform bogus online purchases. Refunds then appear as legitimate reversals of customer transactions, ultimately redistributing illicit proceeds back onto cards or accounts. This practice masks the source of funds and complicates financial institutions' transaction monitoring.
- [Chargeback](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0091) — Cardholders, whether using legitimate or stolen/synthetic identities, facilitate chargeback fraud by:

- Initiating disputes under claims of non-delivery, defective merchandise, or billing errors.
- Exploiting the legitimate refund process to transform illicit proceeds into apparently reimbursed funds.
- Potentially collaborating with merchants to reinforce false claims and reintroduce the funds into lawful payment channels.

- [Third-Party Payments](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0073) — Nominees formally hold accounts or assets in their own name, concealing the criminal’s true ownership:

- This makes it difficult for financial institutions to identify the ultimate controller of funds.
- Criminals exploit nominees to obscure direct links between illicit proceeds and their real source.
- [Off-the-Record Deals](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0095) — Nominees hold legal title or official ownership of assets as part of off-the-record deals, while the true criminal (beneficial owner) remains hidden. By placing assets under the nominee’s name without formal records, financial institutions are effectively prevented from identifying the real owner or source of funds.
- [Lottery Winnings](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0107.001) — Nominees serve as intermediaries in the laundering process by:

- Allowing criminals to operate through complex layers of corporate governance, reducing transparency in property deals.
- [Dividend Stripping](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0147.003) — Offshore entities in low-tax jurisdictions temporarily hold shares around dividend record dates, reducing withholding obligations and enabling duplicate refund filings. For financial institutions, obscured cross-border ownership makes it difficult to identify the ultimate beneficial owner:

- Shifting shares into offshore entities right before dividend payouts can mask true ownership at critical times.
- Minimal disclosure requirements in certain jurisdictions hamper institutional due diligence and facilitate overlapping claims for the same dividend.
- [Securities Account Ownership](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0088.001) — Offshore entities registered in secrecy-friendly jurisdictions hold or operate brokerage accounts under lax disclosure requirements.

- Criminals exploit these jurisdictions' limited beneficial ownership obligations to shift official account holders.
- Financial institutions face reduced transparency, making it more difficult to verify the ultimate controlling parties behind securities accounts.
- [Offshore Transfers](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0062.003) — Criminals incorporate offshore entities, including shell or front companies, in secrecy havens to:

- Conceal beneficial ownership and obscure the flow of illicit funds.
- Execute rapid cross-border transfers with minimal disclosure requirements.

This reduces transparency for financial institutions, complicating due diligence and transaction monitoring.
- [Business Investment](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0036) — Offshore entities are formed in jurisdictions offering minimal disclosures, enabling criminals to:

- Channel illicit funds through cross-border structures that mask beneficial ownership.
- Inject capital into legitimate businesses using complex offshore accounts, making it difficult to trace the original source of funds.

Financial institutions struggle to verify ultimate ownership and spot suspicious flows when entities operate from opaque offshore hubs.
- [Sports Sponsorship](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0129) — Criminals use offshore entities to:

- Receive or disburse sponsorship funds and image-rights payments, masking the real owners behind international corporate layers.
- Exploit light disclosure requirements, complicating financial institutions’ customer due diligence and obscuring the ultimate source of funds.
- [Commingling Environmental Crime Proceeds](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0057) — These business structures are formed in jurisdictions with limited transparency, enabling criminals to:

- Obscure beneficial owners involved in illegal logging, fishing, or mining.
- Layer and transfer illicit funds across multiple countries, distancing proceeds from their criminal origin.

This reduces financial institutions’ ability to identify and scrutinize the ultimate beneficiaries of environmental crime proceeds.
- [Insurance Annuities](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0087) — Offshore entities registered in secrecy-friendly jurisdictions hold or receive proceeds from annuity policies, concealing the identity of the real policyholder. Their opaque structures complicate financial institutions' ability to trace the source of funds or beneficial ownership.
- [Offshore or Secrecy Exploitation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0062) — Offshore entities established in high-risk jurisdictions provide limited disclosure of beneficial ownership, enabling illicit operators to hold or move funds under opaque structures. These arrangements complicate financial institutions' ability to identify true owners, facilitating layering and cross-border transactions.
- [Cigarette Smuggling](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0048.002) — Offshore entities obscure cigarette smuggling proceeds by:

- Holding profits in jurisdictions with secrecy laws, shielding beneficial owners from domestic tax authorities.
- Layering funds across multiple offshore accounts, which reduces transparency for investigators and financial institutions.

### Related Techniques
- [Multiple Citizenship Identities](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0024) — Financial institutions are unwittingly exploited when:

- Criminals open accounts under different national identities, circumventing consistent KYC checks.
- Multiple passport details mask the link between separate accounts, undermining beneficial ownership tracing.
- Varying identity documents reduce the efficacy of transaction monitoring and red flag detection.
- [Wire Transfer Chains](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0070.001) — Financial institutions, including correspondent banks, are unwittingly exploited by:

- Processing consecutive wire transfers across multiple jurisdictions, each appearing routine in isolation.
- Handling split transactions that remain below reporting thresholds, hindering detection.
- Lacking consolidated oversight of layered transfers that traverse different institutions, complicating investigators’ ability to track proceeds.
- [Micro-Structuring](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0016.001) — Financial institutions are exploited through micro-structuring by:

- Processing multiple small cash or electronic deposits that individually appear below suspicious transaction limits.
- Handling high volumes of minor transactions across different branches or channels without immediately recognizing a larger coordinated scheme.

These fragmented deposits strain conventional monitoring tools, allowing illicit funds to pass undetected.
- [Multi-Currency Swap](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0115.002) — Financial institutions hold and transfer funds after each currency conversion step, providing accounts and wire services that criminals use to further layer illicit proceeds. By dispersing transactions across multiple institutions with differing AML standards, criminals increase complexity and reduce the likelihood that any single bank or regulator will detect the entire laundering chain.
- [Loan Schemes](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0098) — Financial institutions are unwittingly exploited as gateways for loan proceeds and repayments.

- Loan officers may rely on incomplete or falsified documentation when approving or servicing loans, creating openings for laundering.
- The normal lending and repayment processes help criminals integrate illicit funds, reducing transparency for subsequent due diligence.
- [Virtual IBANs](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0027) — Financial institutions are exploited by criminals using virtual IBANs that mimic standard IBAN formats, concealing the fact that multiple references route back to the same underlying account. This deception hinders beneficial ownership identification and complicates transaction monitoring, thereby weakening AML efforts.
- [Gold Conversion](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0055.001) — Financial institutions are exploited once gold is liquidated by:

- Receiving purportedly legitimate proceeds from gold sales, masking the illicit origin of funds.
- Providing banking channels through which criminals reintegrate laundered profits into the formal economy.
- [Knowledge Compartmentalization](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0149) — Criminals unwittingly exploit financial institutions by distributing transactions across different accounts or branches:

- Each institution or department sees only its own limited portion of deposits, transfers, or withdrawals.
- Without a unified view, compliance controls struggle to link seemingly unrelated transactions, allowing launderers to maintain anonymity.
- This siloed approach diminishes the likelihood of detection, as no single institution can assemble the full picture of suspicious movement of funds.
- [Infiltration and Control of Banking Institutions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0099) — Legitimate banks and non-bank financial entities are targeted and exploited through infiltration. Criminals:

- Weaken or override internal governance and compliance mechanisms, bypassing due diligence.
- Funnel illicit proceeds through standard account services and cross-border relationships.

Once compromised, the institution becomes a conduit for significant laundering operations, facing severe reputational, legal, and regulatory risks.
- [Test Payment Probing](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0035) — Financial institutions are unwittingly exploited in this technique because:

- Their threshold-based monitoring rules are tested with repeated low-value transactions, revealing the points at which alerts are triggered.
- Once criminals learn these limits, they structure larger illicit transfers to remain under the identified thresholds, circumventing the institution’s existing AML controls.
- [Remote Mining](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0020.001) — Financial institutions unwittingly process cross-border payments related to remote mining by:

- Handling wire transfers labeled as legitimate hosting, equipment, or energy costs.
- Receiving or sending substantial amounts that may originate from illicit sources.

These transactions complicate detection efforts, especially if the receiving mining operator lacks AML controls.
- [Multiple Invoicing](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0008.001) — Financial institutions are exploited when:

- Criminals present separate but identical invoices to different branches or departments, each believing it is financing a distinct transaction.
- Letters of credit, loans, or other credit lines are approved based on duplicate trade documentation, unwittingly funding a single shipment multiple times.

This fragmentation among multiple financial providers obscures the money trail and amplifies the layering of illicit proceeds.
- [Remote Deposit Capture](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0117) — Financial institutions offering remote deposit capture can be unknowingly exploited when:

- Automated workflows allow remote submission of high volumes of suspicious checks without in-person verification.
- Limited monitoring or delayed suspicious activity reporting overlooks sequential or duplicate deposits.

Once fraudulent deposits clear, subsequent rapid transfers increase challenges in tracing and preventing further illicit transactions.
- [Negotiable Instrument Purchases](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0110) — Financial institutions, including banks and money services businesses:  
- Issue negotiable instruments that criminals exploit by making multiple, lower-value purchases to avoid triggering cash deposit red flags.  
- Are unwittingly used to convert illicit currency into legitimate-seeming payment forms.  
- Face challenges in tracing the original source of funds once these instruments are deposited or redeemed across multiple accounts or institutions.  
- [Syndicated Trade Loan Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0078) — Financial institutions, including both lead arrangers and co-lenders, enable syndicated trade loan manipulation by:

- Relying on the lead arranger's primary KYC check while performing limited or no independent due diligence.
- Accepting inflated or falsified trade documentation, which criminals use to justify higher financing amounts.
- Disbursing loan proceeds across multiple accounts, creating fragmented oversight and making it more difficult to detect suspicious activities or beneficial ownership.
- [Human Trafficking](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0058) — Financial institutions are unwittingly exploited to:

- Receive deposits and process payments disguised as ordinary commercial transactions.
- Facilitate cross-border transfers that layer proceeds from forced labor or sexual exploitation, hindering detection due to the routine nature of account activity.
- [Funnel Accounts](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0083) — Financial institutions, including banks and money services businesses, are exploited through:

- Opening or maintaining personal and business accounts across various branches or locations, allowing structured cash deposits.
- Rapid inter-branch or cross-border transfers and withdrawals, limiting a unified transactional view.

Although typically unwitting, their account infrastructure is leveraged to hide the illicit origin and flow of funds.
- [Pre-Shipment Finance Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0072) — Financial institutions are exploited as unwitting lenders by:

- Accepting inflated or fictitious export orders and associated documents at face value.
- Providing short-term pre-shipment financing (e.g., packing credits, working capital loans) without rigorous verification of shipping or buyer details.
- Receiving repayment from illicit funds disguised as legitimate export proceeds, effectively laundering criminal funds under the guise of normal trade transactions.
- [Electronic Gaming Machine Ticket Redemption](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0054) — Financial institutions receive TITO redemption proceeds as purported gambling winnings. These deposits hinder detection efforts because the original source of funds—large volumes of illicit cash—remains obscured by the casino-based conversion process.
- [Pension Fund Contributions](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0037) — Financial institutions hosting or administering pension accounts are exploited when:

- They receive unusually large or frequent contributions misrepresented as retirement savings.
- Their systems are used for multiple rollover transfers, complicating transaction monitoring and source-of-funds checks.
- Illicit funds are eventually dispersed as routine pension disbursements, shielded under standard retirement processes.
- [Remote Verification Bypass](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0135) — Financial institutions are exploited when criminals:

- Abuse limited or automated remote onboarding tools by submitting altered or stolen identification documents.
- Recycle the same device or IP address for multiple fraudulent account registrations.
- Leverage inadequate ID checks or insufficient transaction monitoring to maintain illicit accounts undetected.
- [Domestic Bulk Cash Delivery](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0119) — Financial institutions are unwittingly used once illicit cash is relocated. Criminals:

- Deposit or exchange currency in smaller increments below domestic reporting thresholds.
- Distribute these transactions across multiple accounts or branches to avoid red flags.

This reliance on sub-threshold structuring obscures the total volume of illicit proceeds entering the system.
- [Fictitious Creditors](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0103) — Financial institutions are unwittingly exploited when:

- Providing financing (e.g., supply chain or invoice financing) based on forged invoices or fake payables.
- Processing payments to sham creditors that appear to be standard supplier or vendor disbursements.

This involvement undermines effective risk management and transaction monitoring, as the usual indicators of legitimate business activity are falsified.
- [Financial Product Overfunding](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0086) — These entities, including banks and insurance companies, are exploited when criminals:

- Overfund accounts or policies with amounts that exceed common premium or deposit thresholds.
- Receive partial surrenders, early withdrawals, or refunds that appear routine.

This practice obscures the illicit origin of the funds and complicates transaction monitoring, as financial institutions issue seemingly legitimate disbursements without clear indicators of wrongdoing.
- [Cross-Border Settlement Document Manipulation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0012.001) — Financial institutions, including correspondent banks and trade finance providers, are exploited when criminals:

- Submit falsified settlement documents to access cross-border payment networks or secure trade finance.
- Exploit inconsistent data standards and multi-jurisdictional loopholes to evade detection.

Their reliance on documentary checks and routine processing can mask suspicious transactions, complicating efforts to trace illicit flows.
- [Fictitious Payroll](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0068) — Fraudulent payroll funds are deposited into bank accounts, merging illicit proceeds into the financial system. Since wages appear to originate from legitimate paycheck sources, standard monitoring and due diligence measures may not immediately flag these transactions.
- [Carousel Fraud](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0144.007) — - Provides the accounts and payment channels through which illicit VAT refunds circulate, often unwittingly used by criminals.
- May serve as a single hub for multiple related entities, making it difficult to identify cyclical or phantom trading activity.
- Faces challenges in detecting large-scale carousel schemes due to complex corporate layering and cross-border networks.
- [Geographically Dispersed Cash Deposit](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0053) — They are unwittingly exploited by:

- Accepting multiple small cash deposits, often below reporting thresholds, across various branches or counters.
- Providing channels (e.g., ATM services, teller windows) through which dispersed deposits obscure any single suspicious total.

This fragmented use of numerous locations hampers the timely recognition of illicit patterns.

- Rapidly switch between different crypto assets and fiat currencies, obscuring transaction flows.
- Weaken financial institutions’ ability to trace beneficial ownership or flag illicit origins.
- [Peel Chain](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0070.002) — Criminals exploit virtual asset service providers by:

- Depositing peeled funds in repeated small increments that appear unrelated, making it harder to connect them to illicit origins.
- Converting fragmented cryptocurrency into fiat or other digital assets, further distancing the funds from the initial illicit source.

These processes complicate detection for financial institutions, as each transaction often falls below typical alert thresholds, masking the laundering operation.
- [Governance Token Obfuscation](https://framework.amltrix.com/techniques/T0067.003) — Criminals leverage VASPs, often unwittingly, to facilitate governance token obfuscation by:
